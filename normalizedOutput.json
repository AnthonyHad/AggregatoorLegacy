      "contentSnippet": "API3, an oracle data feed provider, is moving into a new phase of an ongoing tech rollout.\nAPI3’s first phase brought a self-funded decentralized application programming interface, or dAPI. This was automated oracle infrastructure from a single source data feed, according to Ugur Mersinlioglu, a product owner at API3.\nThe second phase of dAPI is the release of managed aggregated data feeds. This new phase enables users to select specifications, such as deviation and time. The team behind the project announced the second phase on Wednesday. \nOracles are commonly used in Web3 to bring off-chain data onto the blockchain to enable smart contract functionality. They’re a key plank in how information reaches decentralized protocols. \nTypically, in Web3, oracle providers have a decentralized middle layer where various different data sources feed the price of the Oracle, according to Mersinlioglu.\nThe problem, Mersinlioglu explains, is that this doesn’t guarantee that all these data sources are completely different.\n“You could still have a middle layer of 30 people, but they all use one data source and that is not decentralization,” Mersinlioglu said. “We don’t want “some rando in the middle” running this oracle node. We want to get data directly from the API so we don’t have to trust another layer.”\nFor this reason, API3 ensures that all their oracle nodes are operated by the API directly. \n“These companies, it is their core business model to sell data, and if they put the wrong data onchain with us, it’s visible, their reputation is on the line,” Mersinlioglu said.\nThe four phases to achieve decentralized APIs\nAccording to Mersinlioglu, there are currently around three to four hundred active self-funded APIs.\nThis type of infrastructure is designed like a pay phone and can be used by people who might need price notifications.\nThe newly-announced second phase builds on that initial stage of work. \n“You basically buy a subscription, where we will cover the gas costs and maintain this together with the API providers of oracle nodes on the respective chain that you want to consume it on,” Mersinlioglu said.\nIn a forthcoming phase three, API3 will introduce an auction function built on top of oracles that will enable anyone to come in and make a bid, receive tamper-proof signed data from providers, and update the price on-chain.\nThis is possible because there are times when there are values in updates that are not defined by managed parameters.\n“They don’t need to essentially wait. They can force an update by paying for it,” Mersinlioglu said.\nThe final phase for API3, according to Mersinlioglu, would be to create a Nexus Mutal for oracles, referring to the decentralized insurance alternative platform.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "pubDate": "2023-08-18T18:55:23.000Z",
      "contentSnippet": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a motion to leave to file for an interlocutory appeal in its lawsuit against Ripple Labs.\nThe SEC argued that an interlocutory appeal in place of a traditional appeal is necessary because “immediate appellate resolution of the two rulings makes it more likely that this Court will be able to assess in one proceeding the remedies for all of the violations for which Defendants are ultimately held liable.”\nLawyers for the SEC claimed that the rulings could have a “substantial impact on a large number of pending litigations.” The SEC currently has open cases concerning securities laws against Coinbase and Binance, to name a few.\n“The Programmatic Sales ruling could have significant persuasive value in various pending SEC enforcement actions where issuers offered and sold crypto assets indiscriminately to public investors over crypto asset trading platforms, including cases pending in this district,” the SEC said.\nToday’s filing argues that the Second Circuit Court of Appeals — which will oversee the interlocutory appeal if it is allowed to move forward — has previously overseen similar appeals to “resolve important questions of securities law.” \nIn addition, the SEC has asked the court to stay proceedings pending the motion and “any forthcoming appeal.”\nThe SEC further argues that a “Second Circuit reversal vis-à-vis the XRP offers and sales on which the Order granted Defendants summary judgment could increase the likelihood of resolving ‘this litigation through settlement.’” This would therefore advance the termination of the case, while possibly preventing multiple trials.\nRipple Labs has until Sept. 1 to file opposition papers.\nThe filing comes after Judge Analisa Torres cleared a hurdle on Thursday for the SEC to request a motion to leave to file an appeal. She did not, however, approve the appeal. \nEarlier this week, Ripple Labs and co-defendants Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen opposed the SEC’s request for an interlocutory appeal.\nLawyers for the defendants argued that the SEC had not met the “burden” required for it to “present facts that would support stretching [the Howey test] to cover all of the Defendants’ distributions of the digital asset XRP.”\nThe lawyers for the defendants also accused the SEC of performing an “about-face” to rush an appeal because it claims it’s going after “what it claims […] is a purely ‘legal question’ affecting all other digital-asset cases.” \nThe defendants said in their Wednesday filing that they don’t oppose the SEC appealing “the Court’s decision in the normal course after a final judgment with a full record.”\nIn seeking an interlocutory appeal, the SEC is focusing on the judge’s decision on programmatic sales and “other distributions” which included the sale and offer of XRP in exchange for goods or services. \nIn July, Judge Torres ruled that the programmatic sales of XRP did not meet all of the Howey test’s criteria. However, the institutional sales did meet Howey standards. \nThe court noted that “having considered the economic reality of the Programmatic Sales, the Court concludes that the undisputed record does not establish the third Howey prong.”\nAdditionally, Garlinghouse and Larsen face an upcoming jury trial next spring centered around charges claiming that the two aided and abetted securities laws violations in regard to the XRP token. Ripple Labs itself does not face aiding and abetting charges.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "contentSnippet": "For the second time in just a matter of weeks, a DeFi protocol has taken unusual measures to prevent systemic risk relating to a lending position. \n The Binance Smart Chain-based lending protocol, Venus, announced on Thursday night that a notorious quarter-billion dollar position was “made healthy” by the BNB core team following a liquidation of $33 million worth of Binance Coin. \n\n\nFollowing today’s market movement, the BNB Bridge exploiter account was made healthy as promised by @BNBCHAIN using whitelisted liquidation without any resulting shortfall or further impact to $bnb https://t.co/TGZ7nbiDPN\n— Venus Protocol (@VenusProtocol) August 18, 2023\n\n\n\n\nThe position was first created in October 2022 following one of the largest hacks in crypto history. An attacker — now widely believed to be the North Korean-affiliated Lazarus Group — stole 2 million Binance Coin (BNB) worth over a half billion dollars at the time from a cross-chain bridge. \nUnable to offload their haul without drastically reducing the BNB price, the attacker hesitated. They might have feared a chain rollback or another retaliatory action from Binance. Instead, the attacker deposited hundreds of millions into Venus as collateral. This allowed them to secure a massive $150 million stablecoin loan, most of which was then bridged to other chains and exchanged for ETH. Only a minor portion of it was frozen by Tether. It is unlikely the attacker ever intended to repay this debt.\nPer data from DeFiLlama, at the time of the attack the deposit from the exploiter accounted for nearly 20% of Venus’ total value locked, and limited liquidity for BNB meant that liquidating the position could pose existential risks for Venus in the form of bad debt. \nAs a result, in November the BNB core team successfully proposed becoming the sole liquidator responsible for the position via Venus governance.\n“As the market is very volatile, there is potential risk that if liquidated, there is potential this large portion of BNB may cause more cascading liquidation effect and unnecessary damage to the market and cause more risks to Venus, Venus users, BNB token, and BNB chain,” a core team representative wrote in the formal vote. \nThe position then largely sat dormant until June 2023, as the price of BNB fell close to liquidation threshold. $30 million tether (USDT) was added to the liquidator address, adding to an initial $30 million BUSD position. \nLast night, amid a marketwide rout, BNB dipped below the liquidation threshold of roughly $220 million, leading the assigned BNB core team liquidation address to step in. \nIn an interview with Blockworks, pseudonymous Venus BD & Community Lead “Danny” confirmed that – despite widespread reporting that the liquidation was for over $60 million – the BNB core team seized $33 million of BNB collateral by liquidating $30 million in USDT in debt across a series of three transactions. \nEven with the liquidation the protocol may not be out of the woods, as Debank shows that the health rate of the position is perilously low, and another downturn could lead to further liquidations at a price of roughly $210.8 per BNB. After the liquidations today, the liquidator address has an additional $29.9 million in stables remaining, relative to $126 million in outstanding remaining debt. \n“BNB Chain will continue to monitor and manage the health of the account as necessary,” said Danny. \nLending markets under stress\nVenus is not the only lending market to come under stress in recent weeks. \nOn July 31, decentralized exchange Curve Finance suffered a $70 million hack. While much of the losses were later recovered or seized by whitehats, one of the greatest losses was to a CRV/ETH pool, which was central to CRV’s onchain liquidity. \nCRV’s liquidity depth and price soon became a focal point for the DeFi community, as Curve founder Michael Egorov had outstanding loans worth upwards of $110 million owed to various protocols using CRV as collateral. The liquidation of these positions without a source of onchain CRV liquidity could have caused a rash of bad debts and liquidation cascades across the space. \nUltimately Egorov managed to pay down large swaths of his debts by selling large sums of CRV OTC to a number of counterparties. \nEgorov still has over $45 million in outstanding liabilities owed to various protocols.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "contentSnippet": "Worldcoin — touted by its founders as a cutting-edge, “privacy-preserving” technology — faces scrutiny across the globe as regulators raise concerns about the company’s personal information and biometric data practices.\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman co-founded Worldcoin, a cryptocurrency project complete with a token and “World ID,” which is designed to act as a digital passport. The project’s stated mission is to distinguish humans from AI and eventually create an AI-funded universal basic income, as Altman and co-founder Alex Blania have explained in an open letter. \nRegulatory roadblocks remain, however. In the United States, for example, citizens and residents aren’t allowed to purchase or trade the Worldcoin (WLD) tokens. \nIn Europe, German data regulators have eyed the project since November 2022, according to reports. In France, days after Worldcoin launched, officials said the legality of collecting biometric data “seemed questionable.” \nPolice raided Worldcoin’s warehouse in Nairobi, Kenya, earlier this month, according to local reports. The alleged raid came days after Blania announced via X, formerly known as Twitter, that the company had paused World ID verifications in the country. \n“World ID is built for privacy,” Blania added. “We look forward to resuming operations, while continuing global rollout.”\nWorldcoin has been in contact with the Office of Data Protection in Kenya since April 2022, according to people familiar with the matter. In a letter sent to the office last week, Worldcoin clarified that the company will “never sell users’ personal or biometric data,” per a copy of the letter viewed by Blockworks. \n“Operator Partners do not access or process people’s personal or biometric data when conducting Orb signups,” the letter added. “They are akin to marketing agents.” \nPeople around the world can complete “Orb scans” of their irises to prove their human identity. Individuals who receive an scan of their irises must consent to biometric data collection. The consent form has three options: disagree (no scan will be completed), agree to Orb scan but opt out of data custody (image data is not transferred or stored) and agree to Orb scan and data custody. \nIndividuals who agreed to the third option consent to having their data stored and sent to “teams in the European Union and the United States.”\n“The project will continue to cooperate with governing bodies on requests for more information about its privacy and data protection practices,” the Worldcoin Foundation told Blockworks. “We are committed to working with our partners globally to ensure that the Worldcoin project meets regulatory requirements and provides a safe, secure, and transparent service for verified humans.” \nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

The authors note that should Colombia reach a point where cash transactions become rare, “central bank money could lose its role as a monetary anchor for deposits and other forms of private money.” \nRead more: Bank of Canada finds ‘significant’ barriers to CBDC implementation\nIf cash use dwindles, a CBDC could help assert central bank money as the primary currency, the report adds, especially as cryptocurrencies and stablecoins gain popularity. \nThe authors noted that cryptocurrencies in general pose security risks and stablecoins in particular could lack adequate collateral and reserve assets. They argue that if stablecoins become primary payment instruments, these risks intensify, authors said, as governments will have a harder time detecting and blocking illegal activities and maintaining monetary sovereignty. \n“Like other cryptoassets, stablecoins allow for a high level of anonymity in transactions. While this may be a useful feature to protect users’ privacy, in the absence of supervision and regulation this feature also facilitates tax evasion and increases the difficulty of preventing money laundering and fighting the financing of terrorism and other illicit activities.” \nThe report’s authors advise the central bank to continue to monitor stablecoins and their inherent risks, as they could potentially justify issuing a CBDC down the line.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "contentSnippet": "With the first spot bitcoin ETF launching in Europe Tuesday, US investors were reminded once again that such a launch is not impossible.\nFar from it, actually, as regulators in various jurisdictions have allowed such products to come to market in recent years. \nFor instance, Canada introduced the world’s inaugural spot Bitcoin ETF in February 2021, and Brazil in Latin America followed suit in June.\nEven in Europe, where Jacobi Asset Management was technically first to offer a bitcoin ETF, other issuers — such as WisdomTree and 21Shares — have launched crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs).\nStill, the US Securities and Exchange Commission remains hesitant about approving a spot bitcoin ETF, having previously expressed concerns about potential fraud and market manipulation in that sector.\nLast week, the SEC delayed its decision on a proposed ETF by Ark Invest and 21Shares. But the regulator still has other ETFs to approve, deny or request additional review time for in the upcoming weeks.\nAs that process continues, let’s take a look at the spot bitcoin ETFs that already exist.\nCanada\nPurpose Investments launched its Bitcoin ETF (BTCC) on the Toronto Stock Exchange in February 2021. The world’s first Bitcoin ETF backed by physically settled bitcoin, it crossed $1 billion CAD ($740 million USD) in assets under management a month after coming to market.\nEvolve Funds Group launched its own bitcoin ETF (EBIT) a day later. The CI Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCX) and the 3iQ CoinShares ETF (BTCQ), launched in March and April, respectively.\nRead more: Canada crypto firm considers aiding US spot bitcoin ETF hopefuls\nThe Ontario Securities Commission’s (OSC) approval of the products came after the regulator grew more comfortable with investment-grade custody and infrastructure services, as well as a workflow to allow for daily liquidity, Ether Capital CEO Brian Mosoff previously told Blockworks.\nIndeed, OSC CEO Grant Vingoe noted during a virtual event held by the Canadian Club of Toronto in May 2021 that major accounting firms were auditing the ETF holdings, adding that the product providers had appropriate custody solutions.\nAllowing ETFs to be purchased through registered dealers is “a better alternative than to have completely unregulated activities,” Vingoe said at the time.\nDespite Purpose’s ETF quickly growing to $1 billion CAD ($740 million USD), assets into the vehicle have stalled there. The products by Evolve, Galaxy and 3iQ currently have combined assets under management of roughly $470 million CAD ($347 million USD).\nThough the 3iQ fund quickly reached $1 billion (CAD) in assets just weeks after its launch, it now manages about $100 million in assets. \nA CoinShares spokesperson said the fund — now called the 3iQ Bitcoin ETF — is no longer associated with CoinShares, noting its deal with 3iQ was terminated. \n“We believe this is one of the reasons why the assets under management have significantly decreased,” the representative added.\nA 3iQ spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment prior to publication.\nBrazil\nQR Asset Management launched Latin America’s first spot bitcoin ETF in Brazil in June 2021. The fund, which trades under the ticker QBTC11 on the B3 Stock Exchange in Sao Paulo, has 144 million Brazil Real (about $29 million USD) in assets under management. \n“The purpose of the ETF is to provide exposure to bitcoin easily and securely,” QR tweeted at the time of launch. “…But, more importantly, QBTC11 places Brazil at the epicenter of the most modern financial regulation.”\nGalaxy Digital launched a bitcoin ETF in Brazil in November 2022 through a partnership with Itaú Asset Management.\nThe IT Now Bloomberg Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BITI11) has $15 million in assets under management, according to Bloomberg data. \nNetherlands\nEurope became the most recent continent to get a spot bitcoin ETF, though crypto ETNs have existed there for years.  \nETNs, which fall under the broader exchange-traded product (ETP) label, are debt instruments typically collateralized by the underlying exposure, such as bitcoin. \nSwiss Crypto ETP issuer 21Shares, for example, has $1 billion in assets under management across 37 products on 12 exchanges — in Switzerland, Germany and others. It brought the first bitcoin ETP to the Middle East last October, listing the product on the Nasdaq Dubai exchange.\nThe Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF, which originally planned to launch in 2022, is overseen by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC). The fund trades under the ticker BCOIN on the Euronext Amsterdam exchange.\nUnlike other spot bitcoin ETFs, BCOIN measures the energy usage linked to bitcoin in the fund. Jacobi then buys and retires corresponding Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs).\nPotential for US bitcoin ETFs?\nThe exchanges that would list the latest wave of proposed US bitcoin ETFs said in filings they have “reached an agreement on terms” with Coinbase to enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement (SSA). \nSuch a deal “adequately addresses” the SEC’s market manipulation concerns, crypto firm SkyBridge argued in a Monday letter to the regulator.\nTownsend Lansing, head of product at CoinShares, told Blockworks in an email that the SEC’s approval continues to depend on whether or not there is a surveillance sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size.  \n“That in turn depends on the size of the CME market plus (for now) Coinbase,” he said. “We continue to believe it will be difficult to argue that those two markets alone will be sufficient to prevent possible market abuse in the spot market but it is not entirely impossible.”\nLansing noted he believes a US spot bitcoin ETF would eventually match the assets under management in bitcoin futures products (roughly $1 billion) — and could ultimately exceed that figure in 18 to 24 months.  \nRead more: An approved spot bitcoin ETF could be ‘one of the largest launches in history’\nMatt Hougan, chief investment officer of prospective spot bitcoin ETF issuer Bitwise, said during a webinar earlier this month that a US spot bitcoin ETF could attract $55 billion in net flows in its first five years on the market.\n“It could be 2x that; it could be one-tenth that,” Hougan added. “But our view of ETF history and of the dynamics of the market says that’s something that’s in the ballpark of occurring.”\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "contentSnippet": "Not long ago, Facebook launched the micro-blogging platform “Threads” — treading on the toes of X, formerly known as Twitter, owner Elon Musk and resulting in a literal cage fight set for an unspecified date. \nHowever, before any punches are thrown (if ever), I’m more interested in looking at the roles that Web3 and decentralization could have for this new app.\nWhen Zuckerberg launched Threads, he did something pretty novel; he went beyond the “shared accounts” feature offered by Meta that allows Facebook and Instagram logins with the same credentials. In a move seemingly ripped verbatim from the Web3 playbook, Threads users instead can carry over their usernames from Instagram, offering unprecedented interoperability.\nUnfortunately, there’s still a disconnect from Web3. \nWeb2 apps will forever be obliged to trust that incoming data from associated apps is legitimate and accurate, something that they still can’t verify. Moreover, users still don’t own their own data, and given Meta’s track record when it comes to safeguarding user information, it’s unlikely that Threads will ever change that for its users.\nSocial media sites have realized that most people want uniformity across their socials. This could — and should — extend to the same verifiable credentials. At the very least, people want the same username within one ecosystem, for example in between Meta, Instagram, Facebook and Whatsapp. And if the users want it, then social media platforms want you to have the same name too; it benefits everyone. \nWhen you sign in to a platform and you have the option to sign in with Google, Facebook or Apple, it’s your credentials that grant you access to these third-party sites. What if it was all tied together into one decentralized username or identity that is undeniably and verifiably yours? \nOne day it could be, but I’m not convinced the big players are developing in the right direction for a decentralized web.\nWeb3: The solution to portable identity \nWeb2 companies need to take a leap of faith and see Web3 as the solution. \nPerhaps these companies don’t feel ready to tackle the data validation problem between applications, but the longer they ignore it, the better the chance is of rival developers generating a superior solution. I see the problem of digital identity as a slow-moving train headed for an inevitable station where blockchain and Web3 are ready and waiting to board.\nThe portable identity situation is ultimately an issue of trust and safety, especially when you examine the problem of misinformation. Whenever I hear conversations about phishing, impersonation, and digital fraud, I just think, “Wow, we really need a global digital identity and a set of standards that people can build on.” The improvements to the digital experience would be remarkable. \nRead more from our opinion section: Congress takes a serious swing at crypto legislation\nComing from crypto and Web3, I can see how blockchain can easily verify data from different sources, but I also see that it’s not perfected yet. Blockchains need to get faster, cheaper, more prevalent and easier to integrate into existing Web2 businesses and their APIs. If they can do all of that, there will be a new future for online trust. \nFragmented & trapped: why Web3 can save our skin\nYour digital reputation is fragmented and trapped on each platform. Each social media site is a walled garden, your data is kept in application siloes, and the app owners will do everything they can to keep you there. They especially don’t want you to try and take your data (your digital reputation) with you. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, you name it, they are data aggregators, and that data is the extractable value that they monetize to keep the wheel spinning.\nI don’t know about you, but I don’t like it. I actually want to own my own data, my digital identity, and my online reputation. Then, I want to take it with me wherever I go. Web3 is going to do that for me, for us.\nWhat could Threads and Facebook have done differently?\nThreads connected directly to Instagram, allowing new users to start with a built-in network and avoid awkward first posts in an empty space. Simultaneously, Meta announced plans to work with the ActivityPub Protocol to create seamless connections and interactions with other sites. ActivityPub is already working, and some lesser-known social media sites — such as Mastodon, Pixelfed, PeerTube, Lemmy and Kbin — are using it to allow cross-platform interactions and communications, the result of which is called “The Fediverse.” \nIf Facebook, Instagram and Threads are supposedly next to join the “Fediverse,” it will show a significant change of direction. Connecting platforms and lowering the garden walls will force Meta to choose whether to give up centralization (and lose valuable data) or sacrifice user experience (and lose valuable users). \nMy verdict on shared identity\nI believe there’s a better approach that Meta could have taken. \nYour reputation in Web3 is surely best served by an identifier for your digital self. That identifier should also act as a self-sovereign data container that is 100% owned by you, that you can use for logins, verify ownership, make and receive payments and complete know-your-customer (KYC) checks. \nYour followers, content and data should all be connected to you, not the platforms you use. Your digital self will be kept safely in your unique wallet, accessible only to you. Permission for others to engage with you will be 100% yours, and they will know that it’s 100% you that they’re engaging with. \nFinally, your digital life will be tied into one identity. Not only will this provide more autonomy for users, but it could usher in a safer, more transparent and more connected internet. \nMatthew Gould is CEO and co-founder of Unstoppable Domains, a Web3 domain name provider working to onboard the world onto web3.

      "contentSnippet": "The Cosmos Hub will soon receive a significant token windfall on a proposal from last year.\nProposal 78 was first introduced in May last year, designed to introduce liquid staking and interchain DeFi into its ecosystem. \nThe proposal sought a total of 150,000 ATOM tokens, an amount worth roughly $950,000. The ATOM tokens would then be invested in projects able to bring liquid staking and DeFi activity to the interchain through replicated security (RS). \nReplicated security is a shared security model used by a network of blockchains part of the Cosmos ecosystem. The Cosmos Hub can be considered the main point of contact for the various blockchains developed within the Cosmos ecosystem. \nOf the 150,000 ATOM tokens in the initial proposal, 50k worth of ATOM tokens were given to P2P, a proof-of-stake validator and remote procedure call (RPC) node provider, to build Neutron. Neutron is a layer-1 CosmWasm blockchain that enables smart contracts to be deployed across multiple blockchains.\nSo far, only 25,000 of the 50,000 ATOM has been received by the Neutron team and a proposal to reallocate the remaining 25,000 ATOM from P2P to Neutron is underway.\nAt the time of writing, almost 97% of voters are in favor of Neutron receiving the additional 25,000 ATOM, though the proposal itself has not yet reached quorum. Voters will have until the Aug. 24 to cast their votes.\nAdditionally, the proposal will provide the Cosmos Hub with one of its largest allocation returns to date. \nNow that Neutron has officially launched on RS, an estimated $12 million will be sent back to the Hub as part of an airdrop. The team called it “an expected initial return of 28x the original Prop 72 allocation.”\nThis amount is in addition to the initial agreement whereby 25% of all transaction fees and 25% of all MEV revenue will be given to the Hub.\nNeutron plans to submit a proposal to ensure that the airdropped tokens can be used to contribute to Neutron governance.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "contentSnippet": "A deal by Securitize to tap into the registered investment adviser (RIA) community reflects a potential significant new step for tokenization market growth, industry watchers told Blockworks — a theme viewed as one of the crypto segment’s most promising developments.  \nSecuritize revealed Thursday that it would buy Onramp Invest — a digital asset wealth platform working with US RIAs with combined assets under management of $40 billion.\nThe purchase allows the company to offer tokenized alternatives — like private equity, private credit and secondaries — through systems RIAs are accustomed to using for reporting to clients.\nTokenization is the process of digitizing real-world assets, such as equities or real estate, onto a blockchain — and backing those digitized versions by real-world assets. Settlement can be conducted in real time, and investors can see where their assets are stored on-chain. \nSecuritize President Jamie Finn said for the further adoption of tokenized alternatives, it was “crucial” to make them accessible to the RIA market — a community he said manages $110 trillion in assets in the US. \nRead more: Eaglebrook CEO: Advisors the ‘Lowest-Hanging Fruit’ for Crypto Market\n“I think you will continue to see two things: first, expanded investor access to digitized financial products through expanded distribution — that is, meeting investors where they already are,” Finn told Blockworks. “And, second, continued digitization and improvement of other traditional asset classes.”\nTokenization takes another step\nSecuritize’s acquisition is the latest signal that tokenization — an idea that has gained considerable steam over the past year or so — is not going away, industry watchers said. \nRic Edelman, founder of Edelman Financial Engines and the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, said there is no question tokenization is “the next big thing in crypto.”\n“Some could argue that it will dominate the crypto world in the next decade,” he told Blockworks. “Getting advisers engaged is essential for the growth of the tokenization market.”\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in a March letter to investors that the tokenization of assets could help in “driving efficiencies in capital markets, shortening value chains, and improving cost and access for investors.”\nExecutives at WisdomTree, a fund group with $97 billion in assets under management, said last month the firm is looking to take advantage of its “early mover status in tokenization” after the launch of its blockchain-enabled consumer app.\nMore recently, Adapt3r Digital launched a tokenized fund on decentralized marketplace Archblock that allows access to short-term US Treasury yields. \nRead more: Asset tokenization is shaping up to be crypto’s theme of the year\nMorgan Stanley-backed Securitize, specifically, launched a fund tokenizing an interest in asset manager KKR’s Health Care Strategic Growth Fund II on the Avalanche blockchain in September 2022. \n“When we announced our partnership with KKR, we were already having many, many conversations with other major institutions,” Finn told Blockworks. “KKR was just the first to move, and many conversations accelerated after they did.”\nPrivate markets investment firm Hamilton Lane partnered with Securitize that October to tokenize funds offering exposure to equities, private credit and secondary transactions. \n“Over the coming months, you will continue to see big institutions announce the digitization of their products,” Finn said.\nSignificance of the deal?\nTodd White, partner at crypto advisory firm Architect Partners, said that while various players in the tokenization sector have focused on different asset classes, they have struggled to connect with investor appetite. \n“Matching Securitize’s recent headway tokenizing private funds with the distribution capability of OnRamp’s RIA network makes a lot of sense,” White said. “The deal structure is also sensible, with initial collaboration as predicate to full acquisition, and their collective success could bring validation and momentum to the tokenization space as a whole.”\nColin Butler, global head of institutional capital at Polygon Labs, noted that the Securitize deal gives “mass affluent” investors — those with a net worth of between $1 million and $3 million — the ability to invest in private equity and hedge fund instruments for which, prior to tokenization, they didn’t have access.\nDeclines of new issuances in public markets suggest that asset managers are running out of assets to distribute in the form of investment products, added Ralf Kubli, board member at the Casper Association.\n“Accessing private markets for instruments offered to a broader public, will require more efficiency overall and higher transparency down to the individual asset level,” Kubli said. “It appears that a number of players are seriously looking at [distributed ledger technology]-based infrastructure, due to the unique capabilities of blockchains.”\nDigital Asset Research CEO Doug Schwenk said that while the deal represents just one step in the evolving tokenization space, it opens up an important path for better distribution. Still, the RIA segment likely needs more education around such products, he added.\n“Many RIAs have been slower to embrace the cryptocurrency investment narrative and thesis, while it’s much easier for them to bring forward traditional assets in a new mechanism or wrapper,” Schwenk said. “The RIA market is sizeable and could bring significant demand should the right tokenized products be on offer.”\nEdelman argued that Onramp’s penetration into the RIA community has been limited. \n“Still, the transaction demonstrates that Securitize recognizes the importance of connecting with the advisory community,” Edelman said. “And that puts them ahead of many others in the tokenization business.”\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "contentSnippet": "A US federal judge rejected six plaintiffs’ claims that the government overreached in its sanctions against blockchain privacy software Tornado Cash.\nLast August, the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) accused Tornado Cash of enabling hackers to launder $7 billion in cryptoassets since 2019 and imposed sanctions on the mixer.\nHowever, six people contended in a motion that the government shouldn’t sanction the mixer, asserting it is software — and not a foreign “national,” “person,” or group.\nCoinbase backed the lawsuit, aiming to delist Tornado Cash from OFAC’s records and limit the Treasury’s apparent overreach of its powers.\nBut in a filing released Thursday, US District Judge Robert Pitman determined that Tornado Cash can indeed be classified as a “person” under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n“The entity is composed of its founders, its developers, and its DAO,” the judge said.\n“The record sufficiently supports OFAC’s determination that the founders, the developers, and the Tornado Cash DAO have acted jointly to promote and govern Tornado Cash and to profit from these activities.”\nAccording to the plaintiffs, smart contracts can’t be considered property as they can’t be owned. Moreover, even if deemed property, “Tornado Cash does not have a ‘legal or equitable claim or right in property’ to them,” they argued.\nBut Pitman said: “The court finds that OFAC’s determination that the smart contracts constitute property, or an interest in property, is not plainly inconsistent with the regulatory definition of those terms.”\nHe also likened smart contracts to vending machines, noting they execute a specific, preset function.\n“The fact that smart contracts do so without additional human intervention, like a vending machine, or that they are immutable, does not affect its status as type of contract and, thus, a type of property within the meaning of the regulation,” he added.\nCritics have argued the sanctions have a chilling effect and violate free speech rights of software developers, but the court rejected that view.\nOne Tornado Cash developer, awaiting trial in the Netherlands for alleged involvement in money laundering, was detained for 8 months before being released in April.\nThe court ruled in favor of the government on the matter through a summary judgment, and the case now is expected to go to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for review.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

Stake, the casino, is barred from providing its services in Australia, according to its website.\nIt argues it has already built up a reputation with the Stake name within the country and that the crypto gambling firm’s use misleads consumers into believing the two are connected.\nThe Federal Court is now being asked to issue orders prohibiting the gaming company from promoting itself using the Stake name in Australia, per the report.\n“The [share platform] has demanded that the [casino ceases] engaging in the conduct that is complained of … and the [casino has] refused or failed to do so,” the firm reportedly wrote.\nIn addition to the current legal headaches, a former business associate sued the casino’s founders in February for $400 million, accusing them of betrayal.\nThe company, which promotes itself as a “leading crypto casino” allowing wagers in bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and dogecoin (DOGE) on sports events and online games, is currently incorporated in Curacao. \nMelbourne-based Craven and his American partner, Bijan Tehrani, have turned Stake into a significant player in the online gambling scene.  \nSince its founding in 2017, Stake has grown to become the seventh-largest gambling group globally, reporting nearly $2.6 billion in gross gaming revenue last year.\nOver that time, Stake has attracted high-rollers and high-profile endorsements, including a $100 million-per-year deal with rapper Drake.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "contentSnippet": "Bitcoin plunged more than 8% to around $25,500 on Thursday afternoon, its largest daily decline this year.\nThe crypto had been trading around $28,000 shortly before a Wall Street Journal report that SpaceX had sold all its holdings in 2022. That appears largely coincidental, however, as bitcoin had already begun its descent, reflecting several bearish on-chain metrics, when the Journal article was published at 3:22 ET.\nSpaceX, which held $373 million worth of BTC in 2021 and 2022, reportedly sold the crypto after writing down the value of its holdings, similar to actions take by Tesla last year. \nNeither SpaceX nor CEO Elon Musk have commented on the report, and the exact timing of the sale is unknown. SpaceX did not immediately return a request for comment.\nAnalysts are skeptical about the timing and response to the news. Terrence Yang, managing director at Swan Bitcoin, told Blockworks, “The fact that SpaceX sold all or almost all its bitcoin should have been priced in by the market.” \nOther analysts pointed to overexposure and market exuberance over a potential US spot BTC ETF approval, which has reportedly been delayed until March of next year.\n“Combined with nuance around how price action has been really apathetic and weak post-ETF announcements, the conclusion should have been short-term caution,” Jason Pagoulatos, head of markets at Delphi Digital told Blockworks. \nHe said a lot of market participants were likely mispositioned because of that hype and were likely caught unaware, resulting from price action apathy. Thursday’s sell-off subsequently witnessed more than $200 million lost over a 24-hour period in long positions.\nPanic sell\nThe bitcoin-led sell-off sent shockwaves through the market. Ether (ETH) fell 12% to $1,530, while dogecoin (DOGE), a Musk favorite, fell 15% to $0.056. Ether recovered from its five-month low, clawing back 9.7% following a Bloomberg rehashing of previously reported news that the SEC may greenlight a futures-based ether ETF. The industry’s second-largest digital asset remains suppressed — down about 6% over the past 24 hours as of 5:00 am ET.\nRich Rosenblum, CEO of market maker GSR, agreeing with previous takes on market exuberance, noted multiple factors were at play, including a strengthening US dollar and a reversal to this year’s tech rally. \n“Strong tech sector buying, BTC ETF filings, and the Ripple win brought a wave of macro buying to crypto in June,” he said. “But that bullishness is fading as macro markets have been reversing course in recent weeks,” he said.\n“The simultaneous timing of Evergrande and the SpaceX news spooked the market, flushing out some futures length. Assets that rose the most over the last month were the hardest hit.”\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1.1% to 13,316 by mid-afternoon on Thursday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also slipped 0.8% to 34,474\nThe case for Evergrande\nThe crypto turmoil coincides with a broader sell-off in risk assets. Evergrande Group, China’s one-time second-largest property developer, filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in New York on Thursday. \nThe firm’s extensive borrowing led to its default in 2021, triggering a severe property downturn in China’s economy. At the time, officials from the People’s Bank of China sought to downplay the risks to financial markets, arguing a contagion-wide effect had been contained.\nAccording to Michael Rinko, research analyst at Delphi Digital, China is undergoing an extensive, state-driven deleveraging of the real estate sector. \nThe situation has shaken confidence and demand across the nation, with recent indications such as a recent rate cut by the People’s Bank of China hinting at developing economic cracks.\nInvestment manager Cathie Wood of Ark Invest also weighed in, asserting that China is exporting deflation more extensively than many economists realize. \nAn unfolding deflationary trend in China, exacerbated by recent defaults within the real estate and trust industries, may be nearing a 20% impact, she noted.\nWood also expressed concerns over the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hikes, which she contends have exacerbated global deflationary risks. The unprecedented 22-fold increase in the Federal Reserve’s funds rate may be impacting China first, with potential repercussions for the global economy to come later, the CEO added.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

Based on our most recent reviews, Coinbase will suspend trading in Canada for RAI Reflex Index (RAI), Dai (DAI), and Tether on Aug. 31 around 12 pm ET,” a Coinbase spokesperson told Blockworks via email.\n“The trading suspension will not affect customers’ access to RAI, DAI or USDT wallets which will remain available for deposit and withdrawal functionality after the trading suspension,” the firm continued.\nEarlier this week, Coinbase announced that it was “accelerating” its international expansion with a Canadian launch. \n“Canada is well positioned to be a global leader in the cryptoeconomy thanks to the high levels of crypto awareness, a passionate local tech ecosystem, and the progress towards a strong regulatory framework,” Coinbase’s Nana Murugesan said in a statement. \nThe operator behind the stablecoin USDT also announced some changes on Thursday. \nTether (USDT) detailed a “strategic transition” and is discontinuing support for “Kusama, Bitcoin Cash SLP and Omni Layer implementations.” Omni stands out, as it was the first layer Tether used when it was known as Realcoin in 2014.\n“However, over the years, the Omni Layer faced challenges due to the lack of popular tokens and the availability of USD₮ on other blockchains,” Tether said in a post.\nStarting Aug. 17, USDT-Omni, USDT-Kusama and USDT-BCHLSP will stop minting. However, all three will be redeemable “as normal” for the next 12 months.\nBitfinex and other platforms will still allow the pairs swap for other chains.\n“While this shift signifies a transition, the focus will now be on directing resources toward the development of RGB, which is a client-side validated state and smart contracts system that operates on layer-2 and 3 of the Bitcoin ecosystem,” the post said.\nTether reported around $73 billion in exposure to US Treasury bills in its second quarter attestation, with excess revenues of $3.3 billion as of June 30.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

Bitcoin has been trading in a $1,500 range between $30,000 and $28,500 for the better part of a month, and a recent Kaiko report found that both BTC and ETH have recently been less volatile than oil. Traditionally, derivatives traders prefer assets with high volatility. \nOn-chain leverage positions may be the next area of focus if prices continue to drop. Because of DeFi protocols’ liquidation procedures, unwinding on-chain derivatives and leverage positions can lead to liquidation cascades and protocols programmatically sell user collateral. \nAccording to DeFiLlama, $162.3 million is at risk of liquidation within a 20% price drop on the Ethereum chain alone, and $1.6 billion at risk total. \nEther is down 4.7% on the day to $1,736.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "contentSnippet": "The latest buzzy layer-one network to launch has run into turbulence in its first few days amid widespread complaints that its airdrops to early users and testers were overly stingy. \nSei Network, a trading-focused layer-1, announced the launch of its “mainnet beta” stage on Tuesday. The latest base layer to jockey for attention possesses significant backing, having raised $120 million from investors such as Coinbase, Multicoin and GSR. In a recent press release, the team boasted former executives from Goldman Sachs, Robinhood, Google and Nvidia.\nDespite the prestige, the network has so far faced a rocky start fueled in part by disgruntled airdrop farmers. \nAirdrops are a common method for new networks to distribute governance tokens to key stakeholders who perform certain useful actions, such as bridging funds to a network, testing dapps, or participating in a testnet. Airdrop farmers, in turn, refer to users who perform those actions aggressively or with multiple wallets in order to reap a disproportionate reward. \nMany of those users are now taking to social media to express dissatisfaction with the terms of the airdrop. \nRead more: Optimized for trading, Sei launches mainnet beta\nThe trouble began shortly after the launch of the network. In a blog post on Tuesday, company representatives implied that airdrop claims would be open at the launch of the network. However, in a follow-up Tweet from an official account, it was revealed that tokens would be claimable after an indeterminate “warmup” period, leading to widespread complaints. \nOnce claims did go live on Thursday, users began to complain about the paltry sums distributed, enough so that the hashtag “SeiScam” was trending for certain users. \nAccording to airdrop expert CC2, the core of the complaints centered on which parties the Sei Foundation chose to focus on for rewards. \n“Testnet users that diligently filled out their ‘incentivized testnet’ forms on a daily basis for weeks got rewarded with $5 worth of SEI and referrals haven’t been honored,” they wrote in an interview with Blockworks. “Instead, you can bridge $10k in and apparently get over 5k SEI tokens, once again rewarding whale behavior.”\nWhile some early testnet participants reported scant rewards, Sei continues to incentivize users to deposit funds via bridges to the network on an ongoing basis. Today, the Sei Foundation said that it raised the cap for this ongoing program from a half million wallets to 1.5 million due to “fervent demand.”\nThe popularity of this farming strategy is such that research firm ASXN noticed a price spike for assets that easily bridge over Cosmos, on which Sei is built: \n\n\nAssets bridgeable to the @SeiNetwork are jumping higher as participants try to capture the $1k in SEI airdrop for bridging in > $10k of assets. pic.twitter.com/YNmlJYgLMa\n— ASXN (@asxn_r) August 17, 2023\n\n\n\n\nHowever, many users report being unable to bridge funds back off the chain after having claimed their airdrop. The Sei Foundation reported earlier today that the Wormhole bridge had reached its “daily limit.”\nSei is down 6.8% on the day to $0.179.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "contentSnippet": "The founder of Gitcoin and author of the book, “Stuff Crypto OGs Know” says, when he first got into Web3, it was “red steak, bitcoin maxi, libertarian maxi.”\n“Now, it’s just fun that there’s people that are into pro-social Web3 stuff,” Kevin Owocki says. “I can be with my more hippie friends and play some hacky sack and throw an ultimate frisbee at a crypto conference.”\nThe space has indeed diversified quite a bit over recent years, but one thing that hasn’t changed all that much is its apparent obsession with money. All blockchain applications seem to focus on financialized elements in some way. Will this ever change?\nSpeaking on the On the Other Side podcast (Spotify/Apple), Owocki cites an article entitled 8 Forms of Capital co-written by Gregory Landua and Ethan Roland. His mental model, Owocki observes, “is that there’s not just financial capital.” \nCapital, the article argues, exists in different aspects of experience including cultural, living, spiritual, social and intellectual, among others. “What Web3 allows us to do is to build bridges between financial capital and social capital, financial capital and spiritual capital or material capital,” Owocki says. \nHe mentions the recently launched friend.tech Web3 social app to illustrate the concept. “When you join the app, it mints a bond. It creates a smart contract that is a bonding curve on the Base [layer-2] and basically, people can buy shares of you in order to get into your [direct messages].” \n“It’s basically financializing access to you. That’s a bridge between financial capital and social capital.”\nRead more: Making friends online is easier with blockchain \nGrants.gitcoin is providing grants to fund projects fighting climate change, he adds —  a bridge between finance and living capital. \n“There’s also an education round,” he says, “and there’s going to be a Spirit DAO — and there’s the Green Pill Network,” — a network that focuses on “turning degens into regens,” according to the website. “In my mind, those are ‘spiritual capital’ that you’re funding with Web3,” he says.\nOwocki defines the notion of “regeneration,” explaining that it’s not only about increasing resource capacity in a financial vector, “but also social capital and environmental capital and spiritual capital,” he says. “Let’s regenerate ourselves along with regenerating our planet and our communities.”\nDelving further into the meaning of regeneration, Owocki explains, “resource capacity goes up over time as opposed to degeneration,” he says, “which is a system that goes down over time.”\n\n\n\n\nWhile the examples Owocki mentions are all “financialized applications,” he says what’s interesting about them is that they are equally accessible to users, regardless of their personal wealth. \n“They’re accessible to everyday humans that don’t have giant bags, not just to the whales,” he says. Owocki explains that he wants to build a financial system where users can provide fair value and in turn receive fair financial value in the form of tokens.\n“There’s a giant difference between things that are just speculative, like degen casino games,” he says, “and things where we’re actually genuinely exchanging social capital or intellectual capital, and I’m giving you financial capital for that.”\nOwocki expects the crypto space to remain primarily financial in nature. But to onboard “the rest of humanity” into Web3, he says it will become less speculative over time, developing “regenerative bridges” to different types of capital.\n“At least, that’s the ‘regen’ Web3 ecosystem that I want to build.”\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "contentSnippet": "A federal judge has cleared the way for the Securities and Exchange Commission to file an appeal in its long-running legal fight with Ripple Labs. \nJudge Analisa Torres granted the SEC’s motion for leave to file an interlocutory appeal on Thursday. According to new court documents, the SEC will file its motion by Aug. 18, giving Ripple Labs until Sept. 1 to file opposition papers.\nThe Thursday filing is not an approval of the appeal by Judge Torres — it simply allows the SEC to file its motion. \nThe order comes a day after Ripple Labs and co-defendants Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen opposed the SEC’s request for an interlocutory appeal. \nIn a Wednesday filing, Ripple Labs claimed that the SEC had failed to “meet its burden to present facts that would support stretching Howey to cover all of the Defendants’ distributions of the digital asset XRP.”\nThe distributed ledger tech firm accused the SEC of doing an “about-face” in a rush to “appeal what it claims…is a purely ‘legal question’ affecting all other digital-asset cases.”\nRead more: Ripple Labs opposes ‘gambit’ appeal request by the SEC\nThe SEC, however, has claimed that the appeal would “avoid the possibility of engaging in protracted remedies” in litigation.\nThe appeal is focused on the judge’s decision on programmatic sales and “other distributions,” which included both the sale and offer of XRP in exchange for goods or services. \nIn July, Judge Torres ruled that the programmatic sales of XRP did not meet the standards of the Howey test, but the institutional sales did. \nOutside of the appeal, there is an upcoming trial for the case. Garlinghouse and Larsen are expected to be tried in the Southern District of New York early next year. The two were charged with aiding and abetting securities laws violations in regards to Ripple’s XRP token, though Ripple Labs does not face the aiding and abetting charges.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "contentSnippet": "The Federal Reserve announced that it has taken enforcement action against Farmington State Bank, alleging that it “improperly” changed its business plan and failed to inform the Fed. \nSpecifically, the Fed claims that Farmington violated its commitments by changing its business plan without receiving written approval from either the Board of Governors, the Reserve Bank or the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions.\nFarmington made a commitment to both work with and help design IT infrastructure to “facilitate the third party’s issuance of stablecoins to the public in exchange for receipt of 50 percent of mint and burn fees on certain stablecoins, and took material steps to implement that memorandum of understanding,” the Fed said in a Thursday filing.\nThe bank has a history with Sam Bankman-Fried and Alameda, though neither are mentioned in the enforcement action. Back in March 2022, Farmington adopted the moniker Moonstone Bank, which was followed by Alameda investing $11.5 million into the bank.\nThe action does not cite a specific stablecoin commitment from Farmington, however. According to a Globe Newswire posting on Oct. 24, 2022, Fluent announced a partnership with Moonstone — following the name change — claiming that it would issue a US+ Stablecoin. \n“The Board’s action ensures the bank’s operations will wind down in a manner that protects the bank’s depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund,” the Fed said.\nAccording to a Business Wire press release, Farmington State Bank “consented to the Federal Reserve order published today. All bank regulatory approvals for the assumption of deposits and the purchase of assets by Bank of Eastern Oregon of Farmington State Bank have been received. The transaction is expected to close by Aug. 31, 2023.”\nIn January, Farmington — as Moonstone — announced that it would be “discontinuing its pursuit of an innovation-driven business model.” It added that the strategy shift “reflects the impact of recent events in the crypto assets industry and the resultant changing regulatory environment relating to crypto asset businesses.” It also changed its name back to Farmington.\nThe bank has direct ties not only to Sam Bankman-Fried and Alameda, but also to Jean Jacques Pierre Chalopin. Chalopin is the “principal shareholder” of FBH Corporation, the owner of Farmington. \nHe’s also the largest shareholder of Deltec International Group, which is based in the Bahamas and serves a number of crypto companies. Tether, in 2018, announced a banking relationship with Deltec. \nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "contentSnippet": "Safe, previously known as Gnosis Safe, is developing a standard with the goal of transitioning the Web3 space to modular smart accounts.\nAs Ethereum co-founder contended in a June blog post, smart accounts are critical to bringing on more users into the blockchain Web3 space. A smart account, in essence, enhances how a user manages their digital assets via the use of smart contracts. \nRichard Meissner, co-founder of Safe, told Blockworks that when the team began its work, it sought ways to extend smart account functionality. \n“The challenge was that these modules bring an inherent risk because the more powerful it is, the more you expose your underlying logic and your account could be abused,” Meissner said. \nWith growing interest from the Web3 community in account abstraction and smart contract wallets over recent months, Meissner said it was a good opportunity to begin delving into these problems.\nAlong with co-founder Lukas Schor, Safe released a whitepaper for a “Safe Core Protocol” that explores different ways to streamline smart account solutions. Beyond general security concerns, the whitepaper addresses potential solutions to ecosystem fragmentation.\nToday, there are multiple ecosystem initiatives around smart accounts and smart contract wallets, all of which have slight differences between them. Instadapp and MetaMask, for example, are all looking at ways to incorporate the technology into their respective infrastructure stacks.\nMeissner told Blockworks that “over the next couple of months, it will be an important task to look at where we can further line up to prevent fragmentation.\nSeeking a solution\nThe whitepaper introduces the concept of a “Manager” which is responsible for managing “Accounts”, “Registries” and “Modules.” \nAn abstraction layer — a separation layer between different components of a system — is used to navigate the complexities between fragmentation, interoperability and security. \n\n\n\n\nPer the paper, smart account users can choose to opt into a protocol by enabling the Manager, which will then give it access to functionalities enabled through Modules. To ensure the security of these Modules, Registries exist to enforce standards. \nSchor told Blockworks that the Safe Core Protocol aims to address issues around interoperability and security. \n“In the long run, we want you to be able to plug your different smart accounts into the same protocol, it’s all interoperable, and it all leverages the same security properties,” said Schor.\nOver the next few months, the team will seek community feedback on the proposed protocol.\n“We wanted to get the white paper out early even though we’re still working on the actual implementation to get early community feedback,” Schor said. “It gets harder to change things as we go along, so we want to get feedback as early as possible when things are still very flexible.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "contentSnippet": "Ever wanted to invest in stocks like you invest in crypto? \nAsset tokenization is already making that a reality. \nNo more physical certificates, no more middlemen. Just a few clicks, and you’re a shareholder. This is the promise of tokenization, giving us new ways to transact, store and distribute wealth.\nBank of China International (BOCI) recently became the first Chinese financial institution to launch a tokenized security — issuing 200 million yuan in fully digital structured notes. This is a significant step in bridging traditional securities and crypto. And this, it appears, is a mere taste of what’s to come. \nThe tokenization market is poised to explode in the coming years. According to financial giants like Citi and research firms like Bernstein, the market could be worth up to $5 trillion by 2030. \nBut many institutions are still failing to grasp its full potential. Yes, you can digitize certain assets and put them on the blockchain. And yes, this may yield some boost in efficiency. But that’s not enough.\nTokenization should be more than just creating digital twins of real-world assets. It also needs to be more about capturing and standardizing all financial aspects of these assets — from their intrinsic value to their potential risks.\nCurrent practices often neglect these dimensions, resulting in incomplete digital representations that fail to leverage the full potential of blockchain technology. \nThe pitfalls of current tokenization models\nCurrent failures in tokenization are more a result of a lack of innovation than a lack of potential. Most platforms only digitize the underlying asset, but they neglect to include liabilities or cash flows associated with those assets.\nIn this context, cash flows describe the payment obligations of the parties: In other words, the expected inflows and outflows of money generated from the asset, like periodic payments from a bond or rents from a tokenized property. Liabilities, meanwhile, refer to any obligations or potential risks tied to the asset, such as debts or other obligations that could impact the asset’s value.\nDespite their importance, these key aspects are often overlooked. As a result, you get an asset-backed token on a blockchain — but the terms and conditions are often attached as a PDF. \nThis requires human intervention to calculate cash flows, which is a major concern as it allows errors and discrepancies to creep in. A similar lack of transparency and verifiability around cash flows was one of the primary triggers of the 2008 banking crisis. \nTo avoid another such crisis, we must ensure liabilities and cash flows related to underlying assets are tokenized, machine-readable and machine-executable, not just the assets themselves.\nExisting standards are critical to a tokenized future \nThe typical tokenized financial product today is essentially a digital representation of a document — a contract turned into a token. The true innovation, however, is in developing “Smart Financial Contracts,” which signifies an interplay between a well-established standardization framework and blockchain technology.\nTo start, implementing open banking standards which allow banks to share their data in a secure, standardized way would make it easier to track liabilities and cash flow across different institutions.\nBy applying these standards to Smart Financial Contracts, we can ensure that details of the tokenized financial asset and all financial obligations are machine-readable and executable. \nUsing such smart financial contracts will lead to higher information quality and transparency. Due to their machine-readable and executable nature, they can also lead to greater efficiency in price discovery, analysis, trading and securitization. As a result, company-wide risk management also becomes simpler and more effective.\nGiven that the entire system would be transparent and machine-auditable, systemic risk management becomes a realistic possibility. This makes it easy to stress test for different market scenarios, offering a clear view of potential vulnerabilities and helping us prevent future financial crises.\nSmart financial contracts go beyond simply being technologically innovative. They are about designing a more secure, stable and efficient financial asset tokenization ecosystem where all stakeholders can transact with confidence.\nWith blockchain-based financial infrastructure, most of the management or transfer of these tokenized instruments can be done automatically on-chain. This reduces the need for human oversight and the risk of fraud or error.\nThe ACTUS (Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standards) is a grouping of open standards to represent financial contracts. ACTUS is already helping standardize tokenization for smart financial contracts. Banks, regulators, accountants and tech firms can use the framework to analyze and report on financial stability and define terminology, algorithms and data models used to describe cash flow patterns.\nRead more from our opinion section: You aren’t thinking hard enough about digital art\nDesigned to represent a wide range of financial instruments, ACTUS improves regulatory reporting across all sectors and streamlines financial operations at the enterprise level. It serves as a foundation not only for traditional finance instruments, but also for the growth and adoption of DeFi by building new products based on a widely accepted financial structure. When built into blockchain-based smart contracts, ACTUS could enable a mutually beneficial relationship between distributed ledger technology (DLT) and tokenization.\nThe primary objective of ACTUS in standardizing tokenization is to provide an algorithmic representation of financial agreements, cash flows and the current and future states of risk factors (market risk, counterparty risk, and behavioral risk) that’s intelligent, machine-readable and machine-executable.\nWith a standardized language and taxonomy in place, smart financial contracts can be easily incorporated into existing banking and financial infrastructure. This taxonomy needs to define the terms, conditions and parameters of each financial smart contract type and cover a wide range of financial instruments; This can ensure consistency and interoperability in the tokenized ecosystem.\nThe promise of blockchain technology\nBlockchain is undoubtedly a game-changer and the most disruptive innovation in finance since the advent of computers in the banks in the 1960s. But innovation in payments is not the same as innovation in finance, and that’s where the potential of this groundbreaking technology lies.\nBlockchain could redefine finance, making it transparent, efficient and low-cost. Funds could be verified without custodians, and cash flows could be demonstrated without audits. The logic of the financial contract can be embedded in the token making pricing discovery far more efficient.\nSME lending could also be streamlined if we conducted proper due diligence — shifting the focus from paperwork to knowing the borrower. With securitization, credit was made accessible to more businesses. \nBut tokenization must be standardized, with the cash flow logic embedded in a machine-readable and machine-executable way. Otherwise, we’re just replicating the old system. After all, blockchain isn’t just about making payments easier — it’s about transforming finance as a whole.\nRalf Kubli is a board member at the Casper Association and an experienced executive with a strong background in blockchain, cryptocurrencies and decentralized technology.

      "contentSnippet": "Chase Chapman is not terribly enthralled with how most blockchain governance mechanisms operate today. “We think about governance as this design space that people give a shit about, and I just think that’s not really true for the most part.”\nThe host of the On the Other Side podcast says that during the last crypto bull market, governance was developed and touted as an activity in which people would want to participate, but that isn’t how it’s panned out for the most part.\nSpeaking to Blockworks on the Lightspeed podcast (Spotify/Apple), Chapman says, “We need to move towards governance as this feature of consumer applications, where it’s built into these experiences.”\n“I’ve been thinking a lot about that and how to make governance more fun.” \nUnless you’re a hacker or someone gaming the system in an attempt to “rug a treasury,” David Phelps says, “governance sucks.” The co-founder of JokeRace explains that’s why the platform instead uses the term “contests.” \n“When you switch it to the word ‘contest,’ you realize,” he says, “everything is a contest.”\n“Every social media platform is a contest,” Phelps says. On X, formerly known as Twitter, for example, he says, “you are putting a proposal to the world and saying, ‘What do you think of this?’ And then a bunch of people upload it with this feature called a ‘like’.”\nPhelps explains that likes and reposts essentially act as votes. “And so you are in a contest, where you’re competing against everyone else’s content in order to gain visibility.”\nUltimately, social media likes and reposts are governance devices, Phelps says. It’s effectively addictive, Phelps says, and succeeds in enticing people to participate in governance.\nDon’t do this\nA blockchain is also, ultimately, a contest in itself, Phelps says. “It is like a bunch of transactions all competing to get inclusion in a block.”\nMost blockchain DAOs are structured in such a way that users are often only able to vote on boring positions that are irrelevant to the voters themselves, according to Phelps. “And then people are telling you, we need more participation because we need more uninformed people making really boring decisions.”\n“What the hell are you guys thinking?” he exclaims. “This is a terrible system. Don’t do this.”\nThe projects that have managed to build engaging governance tools are the ones who have built it into applications and “not even called it governance,” says Chapman. FWB, or the Friends with Benefits app, springs to mind for Chapman as an example. \n“They built in a governance page on the app where you can look at all of the proposals that are happening,” she explains. Governance mechanics should be built natively into applications rather than as a separate experience that “people need to go do” elsewhere, Chapman says.\nPhelps says the “ultra great use case” of governance was demonstrated years ago by a recurring event called the “Mirror Write Race” — a weekly showdown between members of the Mirror DAO. \n“People would all vie to get a WRITE token, which would allow them to have a publication on Mirror,” Phelps explains. “The really cool thing about this mechanism was if you won, you not only got a WRITE token, but you got to become a voter, as well.”\n“What’s really cool about the Mirror Write Race,” Phelps says, “is it’s actually an election in disguise, that’s never marketed as an election.”\nThe governance activity was marketed as a contest, Phelps says, “but what you’re doing is you’re electing this council.” The group of legitimate users expanded over time and decided who else to bring into the community via the contest mechanism, he explains.\n\n\n\n\n“It is this progressive decentralization, where it includes more and more people over time.”\nThings can get really interesting, Phelps says, “when you move beyond governance for governance’s sake, and you get to the point where you’re actually providing value to the people who are participating in governance in some way.”\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "contentSnippet": "Though crypto-related ETFs have notched better year-to-date returns than virtually every fund segment, investors appear to be wary of such products. \nThe Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI) has returned 196% so far this year, according to VettaFi’s ETF Database — ranking fifth across all ETFs, crypto-related or otherwise.\nYet WGMI’s assets under management remain relatively low at $21 million, despite tripling in size since Jan. 1. \nBut a more striking example, perhaps, is the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO), which has only attracted about $5 million in assets since launching in October 2021. That fund is up 151% year to date, VettaFi data shows, good for 12th-best among all ETFs.\nInvesco, a fund giant known for its Nasdaq 100-focused QQQ ETF, manages neary $1.6 trillion in assets. It partnered with crypto firm Galaxy in 2021, noting its strategy to team up with “subject–matter experts.” But neither the combination of an ETF giant and crypto-native firm, nor the performance, has attracted investors.\nMeanwhile, the largest crypto equity ETF, the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK), lost assets despite year-to-date returns of 51%.\nRead more: Inside BLOK ETF: ‘We use the miners to play offense and defense’\nBLOK, which has roughly $500 million in assets, saw net outflows of about $85 million in 2022 and has lost another $26 million in assets so far in 2023.\nThe ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) — a fund that holds bitcoin futures contracts, not crypto-related equities — has been an outlier of sorts. Returning about 70% so far this year, it has net inflows of $325 million since the start of 2023. Its assets under management are nearly $1.1 billion, higher than any other US crypto ETF.  \nMore than just performance\nStrong performance over a relatively short period of time isn’t enough to drive money into ETFs, according to Sumit Roy, senior analyst at ETF.com. The exception, he added, is if there is “a convincing narrative” that compels investors to buy.\n“Right now, we don’t have that; in fact, it’s the opposite,” Roy told Blockworks. “Many investors are wary that regulation might hurt the stocks within these funds, and they’re worried that cryptocurrency prices will stay depressed.”\nCommon top-10 holdings in funds such as WGMI, SATO and BLOK include bitcoin miners CleanSpark, Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms. The SEC sued Coinbase, a top stock in SATO and BLOK, in June. \nThough BTC is up roughly 72% year to date, it is down more than 5% in the past month and down nearly 60% from its all-time high reached in November 2021.\nNeena Mishra, director of ETF research at Zacks Investment Research, said crypto ETFs have benefitted from the rebound of crypto prices as well as hype around artificial intelligence.\nBut some don’t want to get burned again, she added. \n“Crypto-related funds were among 2022’s worst performers,” Mishra told Blockworks. “Many investors who lost a lot of money simply gave up on the asset class.”\nBLOK’s total return in 2022 was about -62%, according to YCharts.com.\nFunds tied to commodities, alternative energy and tech have historically delivered strong returns, only to see limited interest from investors because those investors were hurt by previous crashes, Roy noted.\nOthers, such as the Breakwave Dry Bulk Shipping ETF (BDRY), surged more than 280% in 2021, but did not see much interest from investors, Mishra recalled. BDRY was too volatile for some investors, she added, and some did not fully understand the theme.\n“That doesn’t mean that we will never see inflows into these [crypto] ETFs, though,” Roy said. “If the funds keep rallying and cryptocurrency prices near their highs or make new highs, then the narrative could shift and money could start pouring in.”\nThe elephant in the room\nHopes for spot bitcoin ETFs have been “a double-edged sword” for US crypto-focused ETFs, Mishra said. \nRoy noted that “money could be waiting on the sidelines” for a spot bitcoin ETF amid “growing excitement” that one could launch soon.\nSuch approval hopes became higher, for some, after asset management titan BlackRock entered the race to launch such a product in June. \nThe exchanges that would list the latest wave of proposed US bitcoin ETFs have sought to address SEC concerns by noting in filings they have “reached an agreement on terms” with Coinbase to enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement (SSA).\nThough the SEC delayed its decision on a proposed ETF by Ark Invest and 21Shares last week, the regulator has a slate of others to rule on — or say it needs more time to review — in the coming weeks. \n“While all crypto-related assets have benefited from the rising odds of approval of spot ETFs, many investors are now simply waiting for pure exposure rather than investing in related ETFs,” Mishra said.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "contentSnippet": "Financial services company Republic debuted its own self-custody digital wallet Thursday, which will be integrated into its retail crypto investing platform. \nAccording to Republic, users will no longer have to create their own third-party wallets to manage their crypto holdings or participate in token drops on the platform. Instead, they can rely on Republic’s multi-chain, multisignature wallet which will have “one unified interface.”\nThe wallet, which has been in development for over a year, is supported on Ethereum, Circle’s USDC, and Algorand. Republic said that it plans to add compatibility with Bitcoin, Avalanche, Polygon and others in the future, according to a press release provided to Blockworks.\nRepublic also allows its 3 million members to invest not just in digital assets themselves, but also tokenized securities and tokenized real world assets such as art, music or real estate. \nAndrew Durgee, Head of Republic Crypto, said that assets like these are usually off limits to most normal people looking to invest in the market. He thinks tokenization is the answer.\n“For millions of global retail investors, investing in private assets like startups, real estate, and fine art is opaque, highly illiquid, and mostly inaccessible,” Durgee said in a statement. \nHe continued, “Tokenization solves all of these problems. It’s why we built Republic Wallet.”\nRepublic has facilitated the funding of 15 separate crypto projects. Among them is LimeWire, an early 2000s website chiefly known for music piracy, that is attempting a comeback as a Web3 creator platform. \nAnd if crypto isn’t something a user wants to add to their portfolio, there’s also the option to invest in private startups, real estate, and a number of other opportunities that aren’t specifically blockchain oriented.\nFor the crypto minded among Republic’s customers, they’ll eventually be able to stake their crypto through the newly-minted digital wallet and earn rewards via the company’s validators on Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Aptos and more.\nRepublic informed Blockworks that while their wallet utilizes multi-signature technology, it also intends to integrate multi-party computation (MPC). Initially, MPC will be an additional method for users to recover their seed phrases, while the primary function of multisig will be to ensure the security of transaction signing.\nA full-scale adoption of MPC will occur once the wallet team runs a full set of audits on the MPC architecture, Republic told Blockworks.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

This regulation is set to be a standard for the global crypto industry, with other regions likely to observe and follow suit.\nRoss also noted that the law would introduce new crypto guidelines — transparent product details, equitable market operations and enhanced stability — all aiming to safeguard consumers and ensure legitimacy.\nConsumers will be better informed about products and their associated risks, she said.\nThough MiCA offers a detailed structure for digital asset issuance and trading, it was crafted before the happenings of 2022, which brought up new risks and factors to consider.\nSome also believe that MiCA is overly strict in areas like the prohibition on algorithmic stablecoins and mandates for companies providing cryptoasset custody.\nAll parts of the MiCA rules are expected to be in place for crypto businesses in the EU by the end of 2024.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

About 11% of trades come from the Asia Pacific (APAC) region. \nCME launched its Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR) — a daily reference rate of the US dollar price of one bitcoin as of 4 pm London time — in 2016. It followed that up with an Ether Reference Rate in 2018.\nThe BRR aggregates trade flow of major bitcoin spot exchanges during a one-hour window before taking the average of the volume-weighted medians across the 12 five-minute intervals of that span. \nThis calculation “ensures tradability and replicability in the underlying spot markets,” according to the company.\nCME Group launched BTC and ETH reference rates to be published at 4 pm New York time in February 2022. \nThe upcoming rates will be published at 4 pm Hong Kong and Singapore time. \n“As we continue to see more institutional clients use our bitcoin and ether futures products in active portfolios or structured products like ETFs, these APAC reference rates will allow market participants to more accurately and precisely hedge cryptocurrency price risk with timing more closely aligned to their portfolios,” Vicioso said in a statement. \nThe CME Group offering expansion came the same day Coinbase revealed it was cleared to offer eligible US customers access to regulated crypto futures directly from its platforms. The global crypto derivatives market represents roughly 75% of global crypto trading volume, the crypto exchange said. \nThe average daily volume for CME Group’s crypto futures during the second quarter amounted to 38,600 contracts, while open interest averaged 79,200 contracts.\nCME Group noted in a July report that the number of large open interest holders of bitcoin futures — defined as an entity that holds at least 25 futures contracts — averaged a record of 107 during the quarter.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

Several on-chain metrics have also dipped bearish.\nThe net unrealized profit/loss (NUPL) metric, which measures the difference between the current market price of bitcoin and the price at which coins were last purchased, fell to 0.307, its lowest level since July 7, Glassnode data shows. \nA drop lower suggests a significant number of holders are now underwater. The small move Wednesday comes following a period of disinterest as delays in spot ETFs are predicted until next year.\nMeanwhile, futures contracts long liquidations, which measure the amount of money lost by traders who have bet on the price of bitcoin rising in the derivatives market, also reached a one-month high of $2.5 million on Binance. \nSome signs of life have been observed with the open interest in futures on Bybit reaching a 16-month high of $2.8 billion, though, even still, the markets remain relatively quiet.\n“On-chain flows and extended supply assessments indicate passive market participants throughout the year,” digital assets brokerage K33 said in a recent research note.\nAlso, Thursday, the MVRV Z-Score, which measures the deviation of bitcoin’s price from its historical average, fell to a 1-month low of 0.611, suggesting the asset is currently trading below its historical average — a potential sign of oversold conditions.\nExchanges and various investment vehicles, including tokenized platforms or traditional brokers, are currently holding roughly 3.5 million BTC, with exchange balances at a multi-year low. The implication is that market liquidity is somewhat constrained, K33 added.\nLimited liquidity could enhance the likelihood of more pronounced volatility once the market regains momentum, it said.

      "contentSnippet": "Can Bitcoin help enhance the security of proof-of-stake blockchains? The team behind the Babylon network has published a new paper exploring that question. \nBabylon is built using the Cosmos software development kit (SDK) and was designed by a team of researchers from Stanford University. And as Blockworks has previously reported, the team isn’t new to the idea of using Bitcoin in conjunction with the network.\nThe team released a paper earlier this year for a Bitcoin timestamping protocol for use by proof-of-stake networks. Yet according to David Tse, the founder of Babylon Chain and a Stanford University professor, the timestamping protocol has limitations. Namely, it’s only useful for long-range security protection. \n“The timestamp takes a long time before it becomes secure on the Bitcoin chain, because Bitcoin is very slow,” Tse said.\nThe latest paper explores the other end of the spectrum: utilizing Bitcoin for short-range security on such chains. \nHow it works \nA problem faced today by many layer-1 proof-of-stake blockchains (outside of Ethereum) is that the capital backing the chain is comparatively insignificant. According to Tse, most proof-of-stake chains rely on their native tokens to back their assets.\n“The idea we have is, is it possible to use a non-native asset to secure a chain?” Tse said. \nThat’s where Bitcoin comes in. Although using Bitcoin to secure a proof-of-stake chain may sound impossible —  Bitcoin is a distinct, proof-of-work chain — Tse and his team have utilized simple staking logic to make this possible.\n“Staking has similarities to lending. When you borrow money to me, you might be worried that I will run away with the money, so you demand collateral — for example my house — this means if I run away, you can take my house,” Tse said. \nTo participate in network activities on a proof-of stake-chain, one must provide collateral. In the event a staker proves to be malicious, their stake is subsequently taken from them in a process known as slashing.\n“The challenge for our problem then, is how do we slash the Bitcoin asset,” Tse said.\nBridging, in this case, wouldn’t be an option, as Bitcoin bridging is often considered an insecure process, Tse said. Further, Bitcoin does not support smart contracts as far as its scripting language capability is concerned. \nWhat Babylon’s latest paper proposes is using a particular cryptographic scheme so that once a validator does something wrong, their private key is automatically revealed.\n“Slashing functionalities is achieved through a spending condition which is expressible in the Bitcoin scripting language,” Tse said. “There is a type of signature called the extractable one-time signature — which means when you sign something once, it is secure, but when you use the same key to sign something twice, then automatically your key will be revealed.”\nWithin Babylon’s Bitcoin staking protocol, all slashable offenses then can be reduced to signing something twice — which will cause a private key to be revealed. \nIt’s an approach that could prove compelling for participants — but one not devoid of risk.\nBob Summerwill, the executive director of the Ethereum Classic Cooperative, told Blockworks that Babylon’s “sell” is that stakers are getting yield on Bitcoin. “But that also means that you are putting it at risk,” he added.\nLooking ahead, the Babylon team is soliciting feedback from the community. It plans to launch a mainnet early next year.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

However, Torres wrote that it did meet the standards of the Howey test in the context of institutional sales.\nIn its filing, the SEC said it sought to appeal the judge’s decision on programmatic sales and “other distributions,” which included the sale and offer of XRP in exchange for goods or services.\n“The Court’s holdings that Defendants’ “Programmatic Sales,” as well as Ripple’s “Other Distributions,” were not the offer or sale of an investment contract applied Howey’s legal standard to an extensive factual record,” defendants wrote Wednesday.\nRead more: Ripple Labs v. SEC jury trial is set for spring 2024\nRipple Labs argued that the SEC doesn’t meet the standards necessary to move forward with an interlocutory appeal, specifically saying that the regulatory body doesn’t have enough to show “a substantial ground for difference of opinion.”\nAnd, despite the SEC claiming that the court reached the “wrong result in applying that test,” it “does not show any difference of opinion about an underlying legal rule.”\nHowever, Ripple Labs says that the SEC is welcome to pursue an appeal “in the normal course after a final judgment with a full record.”\nUpdated Aug. 16, 2023 at 5:55 pm ET: Listed Brad Garlinghouse and Christian Larsen as co-defendants.\nUpdated Aug. 16, 2023 at 5:45 pm ET: Added additional context throughout.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

Users can deploy a totally new safe or clone an existing one in just a couple of clicks,” draper said.\nMultiSafe was officially announced on Aug. 11. At the time, the team wrote that its release “continues Smol’s mission of creating simple to use and functional dapps designed to solve crypto pain points.”\nSo how does MultiSafe work?\nMultiSafe is designed so that users can deploy a new Safe across multiple different chains within seconds whilst keeping the same address. \n“If you already have a safe, you can ‘clone’ that safe onto other chains and keep the original address,” draper explained. “Under the hood, MultiSafe is using Safe’s own factory system which allows anyone to deploy Safe related contracts to any chain.”\nThis is accomplished by taking advantage of Safe’s deterministic logic, they said. This means users will be given the same address as their existing Safe accounts on different chains. \nThe Smol team has already built and shipped seven different dapps — and according to draper, is in talks with other teams about future projects. \n“We’re already getting a nice amount of interest from other projects and protocols for us to integrate with them,” draper said.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "pubDate": "2023-08-16T18:36:47.000Z",
      "contentSnippet": "Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base…the list of layer-2 solutions goes on — and seems to be getting longer.\nSolana co-founder, Anatoly Yakovenko, believes that most of the layer-2 chains emerging, primarily on Ethereum, won’t serve as sustainable scaling solutions in the long term.\n“They fragment the user base. So the UX becomes very, very complicated.”\nOn the Lightspeed podcast (Spotify/Apple), Yakovenko gives an example from his experience working in Web2 company, Dropbox. “We had one giant MySQL database for all the folders because as soon as you start fragmenting them, [it] becomes very hard to create links between different users of different folders.”\n“Tracking consistency between two different databases is a major pain in the ass. You would have to synchronize everything through the [layer-1].”\nThe fragmentation, at a large enough scale, causes “massive composability” and user experience problems, according to Yakovenko. “You have to re-sync through the [layer-1] and that’s going to create the same kind of cost.”\n“That’s very, very difficult to deal with,” he says.\nYakovenko uses the example of NFTs to illustrate the problem. “You can’t have an NFT in every rollup. It actually can only be bridged to one,” he says. “If I want a specific NFT, the marketplace where it’s sold is the marketplace that I need to buy in — and it can only exist in one of those.”\nBy creating different states, layer-2s break up the composability of marketplaces for a particular NFT, Yakoveko explains. “That’s the fundamental challenge with [layer-2s].”\nIt’s an unavoidable trade-off, he says. “You get a performance benefit because you create this single global lock around a state and then you can work on it asynchronously from everything else, but you’re creating a very hard composability challenge.”\nWhat about just one layer-2?\nTheoretically, a singular layer-2 solution, rather than the current variety that exists in the Ethereum ecosystem, would simplify the composability problem, Yakovenko says. \n“You take [Solana Virtual Machine] that runs as many things in parallel as it can,” he explains. “It always increases hardware capacity to meet the demand.” \n“Then, you take all the data and you dump it into danksharding” which ideally would be, he says, the “perfect implementation of a [data availability] layer that tries to maximize its [data availability] system.”\n“So you have one [layer-2], one bandwidth-optimized system. That’s basically what Solana is,” he chuckles. “Solana itself can asynchronously execute all the programs, and then pick forks separately in a separate pipeline from execution of the programs.”\n“All the forks are quickly picked,” he says, “but then these bigger systems can execute on the programs. You can then do batch [zero-knowledge] verification, if that’s what you need. All that stuff is all doable on Solana.”\nYakovenko notes that a “fundamental difference” persists between Solana and multi-layered chain solutions. “There’s not going to be a demand for Solana to do danksharding because that really breaks that idea of information synchrony across the world.”\n“I don’t want to split the data availability,” he says. “Even though you might be able to get an improvement in bandwidth there, it actually does still have a trade-off.”\nYakovenko believes in the necessity of a system that actively avoids asynchronous solutions. “When I submit one bit here,” he says, “it’s equally observed in Singapore and Brazil, everywhere in the world, as fast as physics allow, because that actually creates value for the world.”\n\n\n\n\nThe goal, Yakovenko explains, is to minimize “information asymmetry between any two players.”\n“It allows for fair markets to exist,” he says. “That’s the one core use-case that you really can’t optimize away with all these other systems.”\n“The idea of having a single rollup that can take up all of the bandwidth of the data availability layer, whether it’s Solana or Celestia or Ethereum,” he says, “that idea is something that I think a lot of the engineers agree is probably the more efficient design.”\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "contentSnippet": "Arbitrum is where the action is, according to Vertex co-founder, Alwin Peng.\nThe decentralized trading platform has settled into its new home on the Ethereum-based layer-2 network, bidding farewell to the Cosmos appchain environment earlier this year.\nPeng pulls no punches when asked about the decision to relocate. “From the perspective of a team trying to build a product that actually has users, “ he says, “Cosmos didn’t seem like it was going to make it.”\nHe points out that “all the top blockchains” run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) with the majority of total value locked (TVL) residing in the Ethereum ecosystem. Building on Arbitrum has a “really good chance of being able to build on something and having that work matter,” according to Peng.\nSpeaking to Blockworks on the 0xResearch podcast (Spotify/Apple), Peng explains that when the Vertex protocol transitioned to Ethereum, Arbitrum “happened to be the most performant EVM chain at that time that also had TVL.”\nThe Vertex decentralized exchange is “capital efficient” as well as fast and easy to use, he  says. Users can trade on Vertex “as if you would trade on a centralized exchange,” according to Peng.\nVertex, he says, is “something that looks like a centralized exchange, feels like a centralized exchange, but just so happens to be decentralized.”\nPeng emphasizes that while users maintain custody of their assets, the exchange does centralize certain aspects of its offering to ensure rapid trading performance. “We can process all trades and order placements optimistically on our own server and that way, you’re not waiting for a light to travel from different nodes to each other and all of them to reach consensus.”\n“Centralized servers are fast — and we like that,” he says.\nCross-chain messaging for multi-chain trading\nVertex co-founder Darius Tabatabai says that the team would like to be able to provide assets across multiple chains at some point in the future. “Logically,” he says, “you want all your liquidity and trading to be happening in one place.” \n“You want all your capital on each account to be accounted for in one place as well to keep the capital-efficiency.”\nFor this reason, Tabatabai rules out a Uniswap-style model “where you just fork the code and put a different version of the code on 20 different chains.” Instead, he anticipates using a cross-chain messaging service. Wormhole interoperability technology could bring in assets, take deposits on different chains, and bring them to Arbitrum, where user accounts would interact with the Arbitrum instance of the protocol, he explains.\n“Any time they want to withdraw,” he says, “they withdraw to their home chain.”\n“It’s quite a big piece of work,” Tabatabai admits, “but [Peng] is probably the guy to do it, given that he worked on Wormhole previously and has exposure to this from previous roles.”\n“We haven’t got the exact plan mapped out, but we’re pretty confident we can do something decent in that space.” \n\n\n\n\nPeng explains how performance would be maintained in a cross-chain environment. “Most of the things that people sign don’t end up on-chain,” he explains. “It just goes to our matching engine directly.”\nPeng uses an example of a user moving from the Optimism chain to trade on Vertex, illustrating the “ideal user experience.”  The user would send the transaction on Optimism to make a deposit and on the backend, it would be bridged to Arbitrum. “They are not exposed to the bridge in UX, at all.”\nIt might take around two minutes, according to Peng, for the assets to switch over to Arbitrum, “and then after that, they can just trade normally, as if it was a centralized exchange.”\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "contentSnippet": "One of the strongest-performing digital assets of the week has been at least temporarily derailed by a code vulnerability. \nOn Wednesday, THORChain — among the oldest DeFi projects — announced that the protocol had suspended a number of core functions due to a security vulnerability disclosure in a TSS (threshold signature scheme) library maintained by Binance Smart Chain. \nOver the past three days, the project has suspended functionality for a number of operations relating to their nodes, which rely on the TSS. The project primarily focuses on enabling cross-chain asset swaps with a variety of features. \nThe team has stated in public channels that they have a patch for their node operators ready, but are waiting on other projects that rely on the TSS library to prepare their own patches and avoid putting those projects at risk. \nThe statement pumped the brakes on what had been a strong run for THORChain’s Rune liquidity token. Rune had rallied 60% on the week in advance of the release of a new lending product, but the surge has stalled with the token dropping 3% on the day. \nMultiple THORChain team members did not respond to requests for comment by the time of publication. \nTSS vulnerability\nOn Wednesday, the official THORChain Twitter account replied to a tweet announcing that trading had been paused across eight chains, writing that “most TSS libraries in production are vulnerable to a TSS security issue.”\n\n\nA responsible disclosure indicates that most TSS libraries in production are vulnerable to a TSS security issue. \nAll users of GG18/GG20 should reach out to TC core devs immediately. \nTHORChain has paused key-signing until a patch can be released. https://t.co/qRrcrva9er\n— THORChain (@THORChain) August 16, 2023\n\n\n\n\nThe vulnerability was first discussed in the THORChain developer Discord server on Aug. 13. A team representative wrote that “a recent disclosure to Binance around their TSS implementation has caused them to make a security patch to the code.” \nThis prompted the THORSec security advisory and THORNode node operation teams to pause “churning” — the process by which validators are added and removed from the network — until a THORNode patch could be released. Per THORChain documentation, the protocol’s TSS relies primarily on two libraries, including Binance’s.\nIn an interview with Blockworks, pseudonymous developer GiMa of Maya Protocol — a fork of THORChain — said both teams have a patch ready, but are waiting on other teams to respond to the disclosure before releasing. In a statement on the THORChain Telegram, GiMa added they expect the patch to be released in “24 — 48” hours. \nWhile it’s unclear how many active teams are potentially affected, Binance Smart Chain’s TSS Github has been forked 50 times in the last two years. \nThe THORChain team announced on Tuesday night that due to the vulnerability, security advisors had recommended delaying the launch of a forthcoming lending product. \nTraders have responded to the various disclosures with apprehension, sending the price of Rune down 8% from 24-hour highs, falling to $1.48 from $1.61 per CoinGecko. \nLending and options\nPrior to the TSS disclosures, THORChain’s Rune liquidity token had been on a tear — largely due to anticipation around the lending product.\nIn a recent Twitter space community call, Thorchain developer Chad Barraford touted the new product as revolutionary. \n“When lending launches, we are, in my view, overnight, going to make the industry look like a bunch of dinosaurs. We’ve developed an entirely different design that makes the old one look like shit, to be honest. It is a very novel idea and experimental,” he said.  \nKey features advertised in the THORfi Lending documentation include “0% interest, no liquidations and no expiration.”\nHowever, while THORfi Lending is being marketed as a revolutionary lending platform, many observers have said that it functions closer to an options platform, with the new protocol acting as the issuer. Borrowers take loans denominated in dollar terms, and have the ability to “buy back” their collateral at a particular price. The protocol, meanwhile, sells the collateral at origination, and buys it back at the “exercising” of the option. \nA recent HackMD risk report concluded that “a [THORfi] loan behaves formally the same as an American call option,” and that the risks of the lending product to the wider protocol can be considered in similar terms to those posed to an options issuer.  \nNotably, the new product also brings new token economic features. \nOne aspect is a significant potential boost in volume for Rune. As with single-sided liquidity deposits into the THORChain DEX as well as certain cross-chain transactions, Rune is used as an intermediary liquidity asset (a BTC to ETH swap is routed through BTC/RUNE, then RUNE/ETH). \nThis has led to some speculation that Rune could benefit from additional frequent buy pressure from the protocol itself. Additionally, the lend product will also feature a burn mechanism. \nDespite the recent pump and price volatility, Rune remains down 92% from an all-time high of $21.07 reached in May 2021. \nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "contentSnippet": "The crypto boom of a few years ago was truly wild. \nI wouldn’t dare to call it a Wild West, but the way that people “discovered” cryptocurrency in 2017 and made millions of dollars from ICOs for projects that probably never existed, was indeed a wild time.\nCryptocurrency was something new, something weird, and something totally digital. You literally cannot get more online than magical internet money. \nSince then, crypto has, of course, continued to exist, but on a more muted level. There might not be the same flurry of headlines every time that crypto sneezes, but the industry is obviously still real — even if it’s not quite thriving at the moment.\nWhile crypto is settling down into middle age, there is a new kid in town. And this new kid is totally wild: artificial intelligence.\nThe same type of shock and awe that people used to bestow on the wondrous new properties of digital cash are now being bestowed on artificial intelligence. It’s like AI came onto the scene and stole crypto’s thunder. AI is the thing that everyone wants to integrate into their products now, even though it makes absolutely zero sense most of the time.\nI wouldn’t be surprised if we had another cycle of companies changing their names to line up with the AI craze. Remember when Long Island Iced Tea became Long Blockchain Corp.? I bet it’s already re-registered as Long Island AI. \nYou might read this and say, hey, wait a minute, cryptocurrency and AI actually do have a lot in common (unlike blockchain and iced tea). You can use AI to write smart contracts, teach trading bots on DEXs, or help answer customer queries about your exchange (for a while, anyway).\nBut there is actually nothing special about the relationship between cryptocurrency and AI. \nReplace “cryptocurrency” with “cooking,” for example (merely because they both start with the letter C). You’ll see that you can use AI to write recipes, use AI to teach chefs tips on how to cook, and use AI to help answer chef queries about your recipes.\nSo why does everyone in crypto — crypto Twitter pundits, even formerly crypto-exclusive trade publications — write about AI like it’s a totally normal part of the crypto ecosystem? New AI innovations are gushed about on Crypto Twitter as if they are new Ethereum proposals. \nThe answer: Crypto is trying to make AI into its own thing, even though it is so not.\nCrypto has done this before. The entire industry is prone to obsession with something to such an extreme that it seems like whatever it is, it is actually a natural part of the crypto ecosystem. Like life elongation technology. Or superconductors. \nMaybe the reason behind these obsessions is that crypto is filled with a bunch of computer nerds who find computer things cool, and so they naturally find other weird internet and technology things cool — like the aforementioned AI, living forever and superconductors. \nTo be fair, there are some crypto projects that actually are attempting to use AI as an essential part of their product. But so are so many other things in this world that are not cryptocurrency.\nThere is just something about crypto’s embracing of AI that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\nIt’s almost like crypto is trying too hard to say, look at me! I don’t make people millions of dollars overnight just as easily as I used to, and I can’t create a photorealistic image of you as a pirate in less than 20 seconds, and only three people are using my DeFi platform a day, but I’m with AI! Let us into the club together, I’m AI’s plus-one, I promise.\nIt’s even gone so far that crypto’s public enemy number one, Gary Gensler, is pivoting from his tirades against the dangers of crypto to tirades against the dangers of AI.\nFor whatever reason, crypto has taken AI firmly under its wing — just like it took in “metaverse” a couple years ago. But unlike the metaverse, a concept which arguably has a real connection to blockchain, you can’t convince me that AI has anything really to do with cryptocurrency technology. \nThe two are both wild digital phenomenons in an internet age, yes, but they are actually entirely mutually exclusive.\nThe truth is that cryptocurrency may need AI, but AI may not need cryptocurrency.\nBecause now that you really think about it, do you think that the AI industry even wants to be this closely associated with the crypto one? Did they actually have any say in the matter? \nPerhaps we’ll soon see AI politely removing crypto’s desperate grasp from around its shoulders, placing crypto’s proverbial arm back by its side…and walking away.\nI don’t care much about tech, I don’t care a whole lot about finance, either. I care about writing stories and watching weird things unfold. And that’s why I’ve ended up in crypto. \nBut because I’m missing that passion for what crypto and blockchain are all about — finance, tech, privacy, yadda yadda — I’m going to write instead about what I am actually interested in. Everything about crypto that has very little to do with crypto.\nThat’s what this column will be about. All the tangential stories that come out of the blockchain and crypto space, what I think about them, and how I navigate it all as a skeptical former Russian literature major.\nIt’s precisely my perch as an outsider that lets me do what I do: Opine on all sides of any crypto issue, no strings attached, no skin in the game.\nIf you want to talk crypto with me, let’s go off topic."

It would, however, keep the Nasdaq ticker.\nThe fund will also “change to pursue its investment objective through managed exposure to a combination of bitcoin futures contracts and ether futures contracts.”\nThe newest filing for the fund would be in addition to the 497.\nVolatility Shares announced on Tuesday that it was aiming for an Oct. 12 launch for its Ether Strategy ETF, though it awaits SEC approval. \nEarlier this month, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas compared Valkyrie’s attempt to change the name and broaden its investment objective to the first pot ETF, MJ.\n“Valkyrie just filed a 497 that they plan to convert $BTF into a Bitcoin + Ether ETF on Oct 3rd, which would be two [weeks] ahead of the other 13 filers scheduled launch. We’ll see if this flies. Something similar happened back in [the] day with $MJ, the first pot ETF,” he tweeted.\nWith the newest filing, however, Balchunas noted that this might be a sign of the SEC’s reluctance to skip the line and get a fund out ahead of competitors.\nBlockworks has previously reported that bids to launch ETFs focused on ether futures contracts have not been successful, with both VanEck and ProShares pulling their fund applications in 2021.\nHowever, the SEC has since indicated a willingness to consider ether futures ETFs, according to reporting from Blockworks.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "contentSnippet": "X, formerly Twitter, officially rolled out its Community Notes feature in December 2022, and the tool has since become a fixture on the social media platform.\nAnyone can sign up to become a contributor for the open-source Community Notes program, which is still technically in its pilot stage. It has evolved into a vital component of a large community that scans the microblogging site for inaccuracies and foibles.\nVitalik Buterin noted that the tool mirrors certain crypto projects with its decentralized approach, dependence on community involvement, and transparent code base.\nThe Ethereum co-founder made this observation on his blog Wednesday, calling Community Notes “impressively useful, even under contentious conditions.” \n“What interests me most about Community Notes is how, despite not being a ‘crypto project’, it might be the closest thing to an instantiation of ‘crypto values’ that we have seen in the mainstream world,” Buterin wrote. \nCommunity Notes operates using its own version of a consensus mechanism. Before a note is approved and displayed to users, there needs to be an agreement among contributors. This means that even if some contributors have had disagreements in their past evaluations, they must reach a consensus for the note to be validated, as outlined on the project’s website.\nIn his early Wednesday morning post, X’s vice president of product, Keith Coleman, shared a screenshot of a section from Buterin’s blog that discussed crypto values. CEO Elon Musk later shared Coleman’s post as well, amplifying Buterin’s views on Community Notes to millions of his followers.\n\n\nA good reminder that @CommunityNotes code and data is open source, making it possible to do public analyses of its performance and attributes, like this one today from @VitalikButerin 👇 https://t.co/Os2sGk12VJ pic.twitter.com/SCrVRbQbbd\n— Keith Coleman 🌱😀🙌 (@kcoleman) August 16, 2023\n\n\n\n\nButerin highlighted that the notes, which provide additional context or even counter the statements made in posts on X, are not written by a centralized group of experts.\n“They can be written and voted on by anyone, and which notes are shown or not shown is decided entirely by an open source algorithm,” he wrote. “It’s not perfect, but it’s surprisingly close to satisfying the ideal of credible neutrality.”\nCredible neutrality is a concept that was popularized by Buterin in January 2020. If a mechanism is credibly neutral, it means that it doesn’t discriminate against anyone, nor is it inherently biased toward anyone.\nHowever, Buterin concluded his blog by saying that Community Notes isn’t quite on par with the level of decentralization offered by decentralized social media. \n“If you disagree with how Community Notes works, there’s no way to go see a view of the same content with a different algorithm. But it’s the closest that very-large-scale applications are going to get within the next couple of years,” Buterin wrote.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

The $24 million is to be paid by Bittrex’s US arm, Bittrex Global said in a statement Wednesday. \n“What makes this result so unusual and gratifying is that our client, Bittrex Global, will put this matter behind it without paying a penny in settlement,” added Andrew Michaelson, partner at law firm King & Spalding. “We are thrilled with this result on behalf of our client.” \nBittrex’s settlement with the SEC was filed on Aug. 10, with the company neither admitting nor denying various alleged securities violations.\nThe court confirmed the settlement late Tuesday, a company spokesperson told Blockworks in an email. While Bittrex Global will not make any payment, the representative added, it has agreed to be “jointly and severally liable” for the settlement amount as a “second-line guarantor.”\nBittrex’s US arm said in March it would shut down, in part because of the “regulatory uncertainty” in the country. CEO Richie Lai noted at the time that the exchange would look to continue growing Bittrex Global, a separate business regulated in Bermuda and Liechtenstein.\nThe SEC hit the company with charges the following month, alleging that six tokens available on Bittrex are securities. The regulator charged Bittrex Global, specifically, for “failing to register as a national securities exchange in connection with its operation of a single shared order book along with Bittrex.”\nBittrex US filed for bankruptcy in the weeks after the SEC filed its complaint.\nBittrex Global CEO Oliver Linch noted during an interview with Blockworks in May that Bittrex Global and the US business are “entirely separate companies” — a fact he said he doesn’t think the SEC understands.\n“Bittrex Global has made enormous investments to ensure that we do not accept US customers,” Linch said in a Wednesday statement. “We service clients and provide services exclusively outside the US.” \nAll Bittrex Global customer funds remain “safe and accessible,” the company said.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "contentSnippet": "Linea, a zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) rollup solution, has finalized its mainnet launch with the deployment of an ERC-20 token bridge. \nThe deployment of this ERC-20 token bridge enables third-party bridges to integrate with the network, meaning that it will be open to a new wave of decentralized finance (DeFi) apps. \nOver the next two weeks, users of MetaMask’s Buy crypto aggregator won’t be required to pay network fees to on-ramp USDC.e. USDC.e is a wrapped version of Circle’s dollar-backed stablecoin that has been bridged from Ethereum mainnet to rollups like Linea and Arbitrum. \nEthereum’s galaxy of rollups\nLinea is one of the many rollups now deployed on Ethereum. \nSince its launch in July, the network claims to have seen more than 150 dApps deploy on the network, with over 100,000 weekly active users returning to the network. \nAccording to information published by L2 Beat, the network has processed roughly $2.7 million in the past 30 days. At the time of writing, it has a total value locked (TVL) of $31 million, or roughly 0.3% of the total market share among all Ethereum layer-2s today.\nThe layer-2 network is similar to Ethereum’s design but supports faster transaction speeds and lower costs. Declan Fox, Linea’s product lead, told Blockworks that because Linea is a “type 2” zkEVM, it’s compatible all existing applications on Ethereum.\n“If you’re a Solidity developer, building on Linea is exactly like building on Ethereum,” Fox said.\nWhat’s next for Linea\nThe Linea team is working on a unique prover technology, called Vortex, that follows a unique two-step system using an inner proof and an outer proof, Fox explains.\n“The inner proof uses lattice-based cryptography to be generated extremely fast. Then we use self-recursion to compress that proof over and over again, iteratively, until it’s small enough, and then we wrap it in an outer proof and settle that on Ethereum,” Fox said. “What that means is that we can produce proofs very fast, and they’re very cheap.”\nLinea is also looking at ways to leverage besu as its execution client as it looks to decentralize its network nodes.\n“Besu is the execution client on Ethereum which has been around for many years, it’s very battled tested, and we [want to] use the same software without any modifications for Linea,” Fox said. “It’s not there yet, but it’s going to be integrated very soon because it allows us to have a lot of reliability.”\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

PayPal has remained at the forefront of the digital payment revolution for more than 20 years, and we are thrilled to come together in this next period of asset innovation with our integration,” said Pascal Gauthier, CEO of Ledger. \nLast week, PayPal announced a dollar-backed stablecoin issued by Paxos Trust Co. The stablecoin marked the first time that any large American payments company made a move into issuing stablecoins.\nRead more: PayPal has a stablecoin. Will they take on Coinbase next? \nAt the time, outgoing CEO Dan Schulman said that the company is committed to “responsible innovation and compliance” with the release of the stablecoin. \nEarlier this summer, PayPal also enabled crypto purchases for Venmo users, and allowed users to move digital holdings to external wallets and exchanges. \n“Consumers and merchants need choice and there should be more options to get fiat into crypto and it should be us,” Jose Fernandez da Ponte, PayPal’s general manager for blockchain, crypto and digital currencies said at a conference in late April.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "contentSnippet": "Crypto hasn’t integrated into daily consumer practices — not yet, anyway.\nDavid Marcus, CEO of bitcoin tech infrastructure firm Lightspark, believes it’s high time for that to evolve.\nIn a Spaces chat with a16z executives Sriram Krishnan and Eddy Lazzarin on Tuesday, Marcus stressed the importance of crafting solutions in the crypto industry that resonate with real-world challenges and for developers to genuinely comprehend the entire user journey.\n“I feel like in crypto in general, I’ve seen many projects that are basically solving very complex technical challenges and very talented people working on them,” he said, adding that many of these solutions lack immediate relevance in the real world.\n“For a normal consumer to actually use the thing, it would take a lot of suspending disbelief,” Marcus said.\nFor those innovating in the field, he thinks it’s crucial to assess whether their solutions truly address real-world challenges. \nHe urged builders in the space to consider two questions — whether the idea can shift consumer habits, or whether it can achieve broad adoption by unlocking opportunities constrained by current systems.\nMarcus is a seasoned entrepreneur who founded mobile payments startup Zong, which caught the attention of PayPal and led to its acquisition. His rapid progression within PayPal set the stage for his getting recruited by Facebook, where he helped grow its user base to hundreds of millions. \nBuilding on this expertise, Marcus played a pivotal role in the inception of Libra (renamed Diem), a brainchild of Mark Zuckerberg. Diem aimed to democratize finance, enabling users on Facebook’s suite of apps, including Messenger and WhatsApp, to transact using crypto globally, which could then be converted to local currencies.\nBut Diem hit a roadblock when lawmakers questioned Meta’s intentions and the extent of the platform’s influence over global social media.\nDuring the Spaces discussion, Marcus also suggested that he is frustrated that financial technology hasn’t evolved much since the ’60s and ’70s.\nWhile many fintech companies have improved the user interface, they’re still built on outdated systems. \nInstead of just making these old systems look better, Marcus said he’s more interested in the global money system being upgraded to be more open, compatible and cost-effective.\nTo that end, the Lightspark executive said he’s on a mission.\n“I made that decision… that this is a thing I’m going to actually succeed at or die trying,” he said. \n“I’m not going to do anything else for the rest of my life until it’s done.”\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "contentSnippet": "Despite its ongoing legal battles with the SEC, Coinbase has gained approval from another regulator to offer eligible US customers access to crypto futures directly from its platforms.\nThe clearance to operate as a futures commission merchant (FCM) came from the National Futures Association, a self-regulatory organization designated by the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Coinbase revealed Wednesday. \n“Offering US investors access to secure and regulated crypto futures is key to unlocking growth and enabling broader participation in the crypto economy,” Coinbase Financial Markets CEO Andrew Sears told Blockworks in an email.\nCoinbase filed an application to the NFA to register as an FCM in September 2021. \nThe crypto exchange went on to acquire CFTC-regulated futures exchange FairX — now known as the Coinbase Derivatives Exchange — the following year. Open to third-party brokers, FCMs and market makers, the derivatives exchange has traded year-to-date notional volume amounting to $4.7 billion in BTC futures contracts and $2 billion in ETH futures.\nCoinbase said when it bought the futures exchange that it planned to eventually “leverage FairX’s infrastructure to offer crypto derivatives to all Coinbase customers in the US.” \nAccess to crypto futures will first be available to users of Coinbase Advanced Trade in a few weeks, a spokesperson told Blockworks Wednesday. It will then become available to customers of institutional-focused prime brokerage platform Coinbase Prime later on, the representative added.\n“Obtaining FCM approval was our next step in bringing these transparent and secure markets to our customers so they can access regulated futures contracts alongside our liquid spot market,” Greg Tusar, Coinbase’s head of institutional products, wrote in a Wednesday blog post.\nThe global crypto derivatives market — giving investors the ability to manage risk via long and short positions — represents roughly 75% of global crypto trading volume, according to Coinbase. \nCME Group reported that the average daily volume for its crypto futures and options during the second quarter amounted to 38,600 contracts. \n“Under the supervision of the CFTC and NFA, Coinbase will be able to offer regulated futures in a manner that protects consumers and helps ensure that the US remains a center for digital innovation,” Coinbase Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad said.\nCoinbase’s clearance to offer crypto futures to US customers comes as the exchange is engaged in a legal battle with the SEC. The regulator sued the publicly traded company in June, alleging that it has been operating as an unregistered exchange — charges Coinbase has denied.  \nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "contentSnippet": "Bitcoin remains stagnant, moving a mere $100 from last week, as investors hold their breath in anticipation of the US Security and Exchange Commission’s decisions surrounding exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nDespite early optimism that drove prices from $25,000 to $29,000 earlier this summer, the market has been trapped in a state of uncertainty, with participants seemingly indifferent to minor volatility. Bitcoin is currently trading near $29,150 and remains little changed on the day.\nIn the past 24 hours, the bitcoin derivatives market has displayed a near-balanced distribution between long and short positions across major exchanges, including Binance, OKX, and Deribit, Coinglass data shows. The equilibrium may be reflecting a state of uncertainty or mixed sentiment among traders, without a clear consensus leaning either bullish or bearish.\nThe market had anticipated increased action earlier this month, with potential dates for SEC feedback on spot bitcoin filings. No decision forthcoming leaves the crypto community in continued suspense.\nThe delay concerning ARK’s 21Shares BTC ETF, bolstered by applications from financial giants like Fidelity and Blackrock, has contributed to the market’s wait-and-see stance. \nWhile not an outright rejection, the deferment has tempered some of the previous optimism surrounding a seemingly certain bitcoin ETF, according to digital asset firm BitOoda.\nNew dissenting opinions such as those expressed in a detailed letter from Better Markets, outlining reasons a bitcoin ETF should be rejected, compound the uncertainty. If similar concerns influence the SEC’s ultimate decision, it could prolong the current market stagnation, the firm added.\nNevertheless, clarity may be on the horizon, with many anticipating an update or ruling from the ongoing Grayscale vs SEC dispute about the asset manager converting its flagship Trust to a spot ETF.\nThis could paint the picture for all spot ETFs, including those for ether (ETH), adding yet another layer of complexity to muted price action.\n“The conditions of the bitcoin market continue to resemble the bear market hangover seen in prior cycles, with an outsized wealth held by long-term high conviction holders,” Glassnode wrote in a recent note.\nStill, with low volatility comes “apathy and exhaustion” which may signal a relatively weak inflow of demand, the on-chain intelligence platform said.\nWhile major blue-chip digital assets remained flat, the majority of cryptos within the top 50 by market capitalization fell roughly between 3% and 10% late Tuesday.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "contentSnippet": "Patrick McHenry R-N.C., Chair of the House Financial Services Committee, along with other members of Congress, sent letters to Robert Cook, CEO of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and US Security and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler on Tuesday.\nMcHenry asked Cook and Gensler to break down how Prometheum was approved as a special purpose broker-dealer. They also questioned the ties that Prometheum reportedly has to the Chinese Communist Party.\nLegislators also asked about the timing of the approval, saying that it “raises concerns that it was aimed at demonstrating that legislation is not needed because there is a workable regulatory framework for the custody of digital asset securities.”\nPrometheum was granted approval on May 17 of this year, and legislation was released on June 2.  \nIn the letter to Cook, they asked FINRA to supply a briefing to the House Financial Services Committee by Aug. 22, though they’d appreciate a response as soon as possible.\nIn the letter, the Committee asked for the number of special purpose broker-dealer applications, how many applications have been denied, and what risks were assessed prior to approving Prometheum. \nAdditionally, politicians asked for documentation related to the application, and communications both within FINRA and with the SEC on the applications.\nWhile the letter to the SEC did not include the same questions as McHenry posed to FINRA, it did request documents and communications related to the application.\n“In fact, you have touted the Prometheum approval multiple times in public statements to support your position that digital asset firms can comply with the existing regulatory framework,” Committee members wrote to Gensler. \nDuring his testimony to the Committee earlier this year, Aaron Kaplan, CEO of Prometheum, stated that 20% of his company is owned by Shanghai Wanxiang Blockchain Inc and that “according to SEC filings, a representative of that entity, Feng Ziao, serves as a director in Prometheum.”\nPrometheum and Wanxiang entered into a 2018 agreement to develop blockchain trading software, but the agreement was later terminated. \n“Prometheum’s former relationships with Wanxiang and its affiliates have been reviewed by the SEC, which closed its investigation, and CFIUS, which never opened up a formal investigation,” Prometheum said in an emailed statement to Blockworks.\n“Prometheum purpose-built its technology with the goal to develop a market infrastructure for digital asset securities that is compliant with the federal securities laws. This technology will serve as a building block for a compliant and orderly digital asset securities marketplace that protects investors and serves their best interests.”\nMcHenry isn’t the only one concerned with the Prometheum approval. In July, Representative Ritchie Torres D-N.Y. asked the SEC to open an investigation into how the company — which “has not yet served a single customer” according to McHenry’s letters — was granted a license.\nThe Blockchain Association has also expressed its concern over the alleged “sweetheart” deal between Prometheum and the SEC.\nUpdated Tuesday, August 15 at 5:20 pm ET: Added statement from Prometheum\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "pubDate": "2023-08-15T19:53:34.000Z",
      "contentSnippet": "While crypto enthusiasts are busily debating which blockchain architecture is better, the average end user of future decentralized applications probably won’t care what’s operating under the hood — nor should they, says Drift Labs co-founder Cindy Leow.\nArguments over whether monolithic, modular or appchain architectures are the best blockchain scaling strategies will fade into obscurity if Leow has her way. \nOn the Lightspeed podcast (Spotify/Apple), Leow explains to Blockworks that Drift Labs’ goal with the company’s perpetual swaps protocol is to “attract an audience that doesn’t need to know about whatever underlying blockchain it’s on.”\nThe Drift protocol “enables on-chain perpetual and spot trading with leverage,” according to the company website. While it operates exclusively on Solana, Leow explains that the company’s mission is to become a “neutral player” in the crypto space.\nSimple onboarding mechanisms like email logins, with a “magic link” that creates a wallet for the user in the backend will make things accessible for users who don’t spend their days learning about validators, anti-spam mechanisms or the latest network consensus solutions.\n“Our philosophy with the branding and with the product is that eventually, you really don’t need to be a hardcore Solana user to use and love the app,” Leow says.\nLeow notes that many of Drift protocol’s users are passionately dedicated to Solana’s ecosystem. “We love being part of the narrative,” she says, “but we want to get to the stage for the product that anyone clicking in from a TikTok ad for Drift should be able to use it, without knowing what Solana is.”\nLeow says that to achieve true scalability, additional layers of abstraction will need to be added over the underlying blockchain technology. \nToo much at one time\nDrift protocol lead engineer Crisp Heaney agrees. “Over time, there should be more abstractions and it should be easier to interact with things without knowing the blockchain you’re on,” he says.\nA common strategic misstep, Heaney says, is believing in the concept of abstraction but instead trying to do “too much at one time” by building on multiple chains. Competitors who are “super-focused,” building on a single chain are likely to draw more consumer demand, Heaney says. And if they’re better at delivering a good product, he says, “you’ve just lost everywhere.”\n“Even though, in theory, you should keep abstracting, in practice, you need to be super-focused on where you spend your time,” says Heaney.\nHeaney says he is a “big proponent” of going “all-in” on one place, “and making that place great — versus trying to hedge our bets and have Drift deploy on multiple chains.”\n“It’s just really tough to do that and not lose to a more focused team,” Heaney says.\nLeow says the company is working on putting themselves “front and center” for broader distribution opportunities. She mentions Solana’s Backpack wallet, where the company built a xNFT leaderboard feature that drew people into using Drift. \n\n\n\n\n“We found that that was a funnel for a lot of more NFT-focused traders to actually come in and start using it via Backpack,” she says. “Our app has so many different functions, you need to build pockets of access in multiple different places.”\nHeaney adds: “We’re just trying to make it as easy as possible to get to Drift.”\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?
