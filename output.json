Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, called the filing “odd,” adding that it could mean Ark Invest is “not that confident” its spot bitcoin fund will be approved.\n\n\nOdd filing given how saturated this space is…\nWonder if there's anything to read into here re: ARK's confidence around spot btc approval (which if that happens, these blockchain ETFs would face an addn'l headwind in terms of competition). \nSo maybe ARK not that confident.\n— Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) August 14, 2023\n\n\n\n\nMany crypto ETFs are among the top-performing funds so far this year. The Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI) leads the way, with a year-to-date return of 219%, according to VettaFi’s ETF Database.   \nThe ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) — the first and largest bitcoin futures ETF — is up 71% since the start of the year. The Global X Blockchain and Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITS), which deploys a blended strategy similar to the proposed ARKD fund, has returned 112% so far in 2023. \nArk and 21Shares are not the only ones on a crypto product proposal spree. Bitwise Asset Management and ProShares combined for seven ether-related ETF proposals earlier this month.\nBitwise also has an active spot bitcoin ETF filing. The SEC is set to approve, deny or say it needs more time to consider that product by Sept. 1.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "content": "\n<p>On-chain perpetual trading exchange dYdX is poised to embrace full decentralization with its upcoming v4 protocol design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consequently, its order book — comprising buy and sell orders for different crypto trading pairs — will be decentralized and, as a result, kept in the hands of validators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But new research prepared by staking provider Chorus One suggests that ethical concerns could arise under such a framework — leading to potential disruptions on the exchange.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via its grant platform, <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/dydx\">dYdX</a> itself funded the research, to the tune of $36,000.

      "contentSnippet": "On-chain perpetual trading exchange dYdX is poised to embrace full decentralization with its upcoming v4 protocol design.\nConsequently, its order book — comprising buy and sell orders for different crypto trading pairs — will be decentralized and, as a result, kept in the hands of validators.\nBut new research prepared by staking provider Chorus One suggests that ethical concerns could arise under such a framework — leading to potential disruptions on the exchange. \nVia its grant platform, dYdX itself funded the research, to the tune of $36,000.

      "content": "\n<p>TeraWulf released its second quarter earnings Monday morning, showing a continued trend of upward momentum for the American bitcoin miner.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TeraWulf’s revenue came in at $15.5 million for the three months ending on June 30, representing an increase of 34% quarter over quarter, according to the <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/08/14/2724293/0/en/TeraWulf-Reports-Second-Quarter-2023-Results-Financial-Results.html\">report</a>. This was buoyed by the company’s revenue per bitcoin rising 21%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company’s total self mining hash rate jumped 67% to 5.5 exahashes per second (EH/s). Similarly, it also self-mined 70% more bitcoin in the second quarter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These strong numbers were telegraphed by TeraWulf more than doubling its operating mining power since the beginning of the year. July’s average operating hash rate clocked in at 4.7 EH/s, while January’s was 2 EH/s, according to data provided by TeraWulf.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given these numbers, TeraWulf CEO Paul Prager expressed confidence in the company’s continued positive performance. However, he didn’t just say he was confident. He revealed that he was a fellow investor in TeraWulf.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In only the last year, I have personally invested over $12 million of my own money. And collectively, our insiders own approximately 55% of the company’s shares,” Prager said on the earnings call.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He continued, “In short, we only win if you win.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TeraWulf CEO Paul Prager cited its Lake Mariner data center in New York as a major driver of future growth. It’s a site that TeraWulf touts as 91% zero-carbon (mostly hydropower and nuclear).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“As we move into the third quarter, we are actively expanding our Lake Mariner facility by 60% with the addition of 43 [megawatts] of infrastructure and 18,500 of the latest generation S19j XPs,” Prager said in a statement. “This near term expansion will further establish TeraWulf as one of the most efficient mining fleets in the sector.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chief Financial Officer Patrick Fleury added that profitability post halving in 2024 is top of mind. To that end, Fleury claimed on the earnings call that 18,500 new miners could immediately reduce the unit economic cost to mine bitcoin by 17%, savings that would make it much easier to generate cash flow when block rewards are cut to 3.125 BTC per block next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, both Prager and Fleury see the bitcoin mining industry consolidating as the halving event comes closer, with Prager saying there’ll be natural winners and losers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fleury pointed to how independent power producers and oil and gas companies have merged over the last twenty or so years, leaving fewer and fewer firms. He said he believes the same will happen with bitcoin mining since it’s a commodities industry similar to oil and gas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There’s 20-something public companies in the space. That’s just too many and anybody that’s been around commodity markets long enough has seen consolidation,” Fleury said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">More on TeraWulf’s mining operations</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">TeraWulf’s Lake Mariner data center there completed construction on its second building in June 2023. With two buildings now up and running, the Lake Mariner site has 110 megawatts (MW) of operating capacity, with a goal of 153 MW by the end of the year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With all of that added power, TeraWulf expects to increase its total self-mining hash rate to 7.9 EH/s, according to the earnings release. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lake Mariner site is also getting a third building to house newly-ordered mining machines. That could be finished by the end of 2023.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TeraWulf’s other location, the fully nuclear-powered Nautilus facility in Pennsylvania, has now reached a fully operational 50 MW and 1.9 EH/s. The plan is to expand that to 100 MW, pending capital availability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prager added that TeraWulf’s lack of reliance on carbon-based energy positions the company well for he believes “will be an increasingly stringent regulatory environment.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TeraWulf’s interest in nuclear power goes back at least to January 2023, when an executive told Blockworks that <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-mining-nuclear-energy\">the company is in talks with nuclear operators throughout the country</a> to power mining rigs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also back in January, TeraWulf was at times trading below $1, attaining the label of a penny stock. Its shares, under ticker symbol WULF, have since charged into the green by over 250% year to date.

Companies keen to enter the space would also be empowered to tap on banks’ support to develop robust inside-out strategies, complete with sound tokenomics and custody mechanisms.\nBuilding with intention\nEven as the underlying tech progresses, how can we make the space conducive for all? This endeavor won’t happen on its own. Despite its relative infancy, bad actors have already found ways to exploit the metaverse for unsavory deeds. \nHow do we facilitate its continued development while keeping these same ills at bay?\nFor governments and businesses, this means asking the types of complex questions that stress test the balance between providing directed experiences and allowing for community-driven ones. On the flip side, society must navigate the push-and-pull of self-governance or entrusting responsibility to the powers that be. \nAs continued investments within the space would dictate, the metaverse is still very much alive — and to give up on it this early would be to miss out on the early advantages of a new technological era. \nFar from the Big Tech players that sought short-term monetization gains via an outside-in approach, we must now channel a greater sense of meaning and responsibility — driven collectively by all stakeholders — as we build these new worlds for the generations ahead. \nPerhaps this frames it well – let’s make the metaverse work not for one, nor for some, but for as much of humanity as we can, and if possible, for all.\nChee Kin leads the team which manages the legal and regulatory risk of DBS across legal entities, segments and geographies.

This is especially notable for those focusing on multi-strategy and yield-bearing approaches. This uptick comes as we approach the anniversary of Q4 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a research report focusing on crypto hedge funds through the first half of 2023, 21e6 Capital of Switzerland found that directional funds underperformed <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/price/btc\">bitcoin</a> as the asset took off in the first half of the year. Quantitative strategies and futures-focused approaches also lagged crypto’s largest player, which soared about 84% from January through June.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/coinshares-pushing-into-active-management\">But there have been signs of life when it comes to new launches.&nbsp;</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most funds were in the green, but the green wasn’t good enough to attract capital, in many cases, according to 21e6 Capital. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In our regular conversations with crypto funds, we sense that the market sentiment among their LPs/investors is still lower than would be expected after a positive start to the year,” the firm writes in its August report. “Many funds certainly lagged the market and now have a harder time presenting a value proposition to their prospective investors.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the fourth quarter of 2022, institutional investors with traditional finance ties had been ramping up their due diligence as the bull market continued to build, before it ground to an abrupt halt as <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/ftx\">FTX</a> imploded.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good number of those Wall Street types, according to industry participants, pumped the brakes on the checks they had been planning to write. And some have continued to stay on the sidelines, driven, at least in part, by regulatory uncertainty that continues to cloud the sector’s US outlook.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crypto-native funds have mostly stayed the course – even if some players have moved more substantially into cash than they typically would. Meanwhile, digital asset markets saw a decline in July, retracting a portion of their gains from the first half of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/prochain-capital\">ProChain Capital</a> is a multi-strategy crypto fund that invests in spot cryptocurrencies, equity and debt associated with digital assets, and venture investments. According to a tear sheet shared with existing and potential investors, the fund reported a 42.21% increase through the end of July.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ProChain, run by its president, David Tawil, dipped 3.2% in July as the fund looks to recover from a 65.15% plunge in 2022, its first full-year negative result.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an accompanying note to investors, Tawil wrote that the recent Ripple decision that played out in a federal district court was the “biggest crypto-related development of the last few weeks.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The SEC’s stance that all crypto assets, except for Bitcoin, are securities was definitely undermined,” Tawil said, going on to note a number of outstanding issues at play in the case, and issues outstanding in the US regulatory landscape more broadly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hedge funds become buyers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hedge fund managers have staked out broader investment mandates in an effort to capitalize on a number of ongoing dislocation opportunities in crypto markets. Last year marked the rise of specialist institutional funds, strategies that bet it all on their investment team’s ability to derive alpha from a particular sector. Yield-farming approaches came into vogue, and a number of asset managers trading nothing but crypto derivatives gained steam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Faced with smaller capital reserves, as well as more limited opportunities in asset terms to deploy funds in a bear market, traders have been branching out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ramped-up buying and selling on Curve DAO (<a href=\"https://blockworks.co/price/crv\">CRV</a>) in the last couple of weeks has marked a key example. The result, according to multiple research reports, has been a sudden spike in liquidity on the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/category/defi\">DeFi</a> protocol.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/crypto-hedge-funds-prediction\">Crypto hedge funds expect digital assets will be up by the end of the year</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Lawant, the head of research for crypto prime brokerage <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/falconx\">FalconX</a>, wrote in a research report on Tuesday that the firm saw “strong activity in CRV from hedge funds, with buy and sell volumes almost evenly distributed.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The week prior, FalconX researchers highlighted a trading trend — namely that, “hedge funds and retail aggregators [have been] better buyers while venture funds and institutional wealth managers as better sellers.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Persistent buys of digital assets, as well as derivatives, by crypto hedge fund managers may reflect a conviction that the market’s bottom is in — or, at least, has been priced in. The buying trend marked a market uptick from July, according to FalconX data, when hedge funds were deemed better sellers, representing 53% of total flows.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\">\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter?source=end\">Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter</a>&nbsp;now.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want alpha sent directly to your inbox?

Quantitative strategies and futures-focused approaches also lagged crypto’s largest player, which soared about 84% from January through June.\nBut there have been signs of life when it comes to new launches. \nMost funds were in the green, but the green wasn’t good enough to attract capital, in many cases, according to 21e6 Capital. \n“In our regular conversations with crypto funds, we sense that the market sentiment among their LPs/investors is still lower than would be expected after a positive start to the year,” the firm writes in its August report. “Many funds certainly lagged the market and now have a harder time presenting a value proposition to their prospective investors.”\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, institutional investors with traditional finance ties had been ramping up their due diligence as the bull market continued to build, before it ground to an abrupt halt as FTX imploded. \nA good number of those Wall Street types, according to industry participants, pumped the brakes on the checks they had been planning to write. And some have continued to stay on the sidelines, driven, at least in part, by regulatory uncertainty that continues to cloud the sector’s US outlook. \nCrypto-native funds have mostly stayed the course – even if some players have moved more substantially into cash than they typically would. Meanwhile, digital asset markets saw a decline in July, retracting a portion of their gains from the first half of the year.\nProChain Capital is a multi-strategy crypto fund that invests in spot cryptocurrencies, equity and debt associated with digital assets, and venture investments. According to a tear sheet shared with existing and potential investors, the fund reported a 42.21% increase through the end of July.\nProChain, run by its president, David Tawil, dipped 3.2% in July as the fund looks to recover from a 65.15% plunge in 2022, its first full-year negative result. \nIn an accompanying note to investors, Tawil wrote that the recent Ripple decision that played out in a federal district court was the “biggest crypto-related development of the last few weeks.” \n“The SEC’s stance that all crypto assets, except for Bitcoin, are securities was definitely undermined,” Tawil said, going on to note a number of outstanding issues at play in the case, and issues outstanding in the US regulatory landscape more broadly.\nHedge funds become buyers\nHedge fund managers have staked out broader investment mandates in an effort to capitalize on a number of ongoing dislocation opportunities in crypto markets. Last year marked the rise of specialist institutional funds, strategies that bet it all on their investment team’s ability to derive alpha from a particular sector. Yield-farming approaches came into vogue, and a number of asset managers trading nothing but crypto derivatives gained steam.\nFaced with smaller capital reserves, as well as more limited opportunities in asset terms to deploy funds in a bear market, traders have been branching out. \nRamped-up buying and selling on Curve DAO (CRV) in the last couple of weeks has marked a key example. The result, according to multiple research reports, has been a sudden spike in liquidity on the DeFi protocol. \nRead more: Crypto hedge funds expect digital assets will be up by the end of the year\nDavid Lawant, the head of research for crypto prime brokerage FalconX, wrote in a research report on Tuesday that the firm saw “strong activity in CRV from hedge funds, with buy and sell volumes almost evenly distributed.” \nThe week prior, FalconX researchers highlighted a trading trend — namely that, “hedge funds and retail aggregators [have been] better buyers while venture funds and institutional wealth managers as better sellers.” \nPersistent buys of digital assets, as well as derivatives, by crypto hedge fund managers may reflect a conviction that the market’s bottom is in — or, at least, has been priced in. The buying trend marked a market uptick from July, according to FalconX data, when hedge funds were deemed better sellers, representing 53% of total flows.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

The company has been working on ways to make blockchain payments more user-friendly and accessible.\nVisa reportedly began experimenting with converting digital assets into fiat payments on the Ethereum blockchain earlier this year. The aim is to parallel its current foreign currency exchange processes, as part of its broader push to build proficiency in global settlements involving both digital and traditional currencies.\nIn the context of transactions on blockchains like Ethereum, every operation conducted incurs a cost known as a “gas” fee, representing the computational effort required to execute the operation. Gas fees help keep the Ethereum network secure by making it costly for bad actors to spam the network.\nSince inception, network fees have been a fundamental part of ensuring security and encouraging adoption within first-generation blockchain systems. Though, following ten years of user growth, the hope is the trajectory of Web3 will move towards a “gasless” future.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

It didn’t even seem possible, and the mystery resulted in me becoming obsessed with figuring out how they worked,” Milson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During this time, he built <a href=\"https://github.com/andrewmilson/ministark\">miniSTARK</a>, a tool that enables you to prove the integrity of arbitrary computations using STARKs and also spent time learning about Cairo — a STARK programming language.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Its simplicity is beautiful, and the fact that StarkNet is built on top of it strikes me as very strong,” Milson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Process of submitting proofs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>STARK verifiers are very similar in structure to their provers, Milson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>“</strong>Being able to see <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/starkware\">StarkWare</a>‘s verifier contracts on Ethereum essentially provided me with a blueprint that I was able to follow line by line,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Milson began copying <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/solidity\">Solidity</a> contracts into a foundry project and wrote tests for the verifyProof process, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was an iterative process that involved the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Modifying Sandstorm and miniSTARK</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Re-generating the proof</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Re-running the test</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>“Each iteration, I’d get slightly more lines of code passing until the whole test worked,” Milson said. “I used the passing proof and submitted it to <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> using Etherscanner. It was a real thrill once everything was submitted on-chain.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Milson believes that being able to submit his own prover is a step towards decentralization for StarkNet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Teams in the community can start integrating the prover into their work which will bring a lot of scale and interesting use cases to the ecosystem, for example, onchain Gaming and ZKML,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This sentiment is shared by Liron Hayman, the head of business development at Starkware.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is a very important milestone towards decentralization of the Starknet tech stack. Andrew was able to develop his prover without viewing the code of StarkWare’s prover,” Hayman told Blockworks. “A mature decentralized blockchain like Starknet requires a vibrant community developing multiple implementations of each component. Andrew’s work is taking STARK technology to serious decentralization — and by extension, towards fulfilling its potential.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Milson believes his work can also be viewed as an audit of StarkNet’s existing verifier and a testament to the security of the network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I inspected every line of code and I couldn’t find a bug which was honestly a bit disappointing considering how juicy StarkNet’s bug bounty program is, but really impressive on StarkWare’s behalf,” Milson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Updated on Aug. 14, 2023 at 12:10 pm ET: Andrew Milson is no longer a senior software engineer at Immutable. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\">\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter?source=end\">Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter</a>&nbsp;now.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want alpha sent directly to your inbox?

It didn’t even seem possible, and the mystery resulted in me becoming obsessed with figuring out how they worked,” Milson said.\nDuring this time, he built miniSTARK, a tool that enables you to prove the integrity of arbitrary computations using STARKs and also spent time learning about Cairo — a STARK programming language. \n“Its simplicity is beautiful, and the fact that StarkNet is built on top of it strikes me as very strong,” Milson said.\nProcess of submitting proofs\nSTARK verifiers are very similar in structure to their provers, Milson said.\n“Being able to see StarkWare‘s verifier contracts on Ethereum essentially provided me with a blueprint that I was able to follow line by line,” he said.\nMilson began copying Solidity contracts into a foundry project and wrote tests for the verifyProof process, he said.\nIt was an iterative process that involved the following:\nModifying Sandstorm and miniSTARK\nRe-generating the proof\nRe-running the test\n“Each iteration, I’d get slightly more lines of code passing until the whole test worked,” Milson said. “I used the passing proof and submitted it to Ethereum using Etherscanner. It was a real thrill once everything was submitted on-chain.”\nMilson believes that being able to submit his own prover is a step towards decentralization for StarkNet. \n“Teams in the community can start integrating the prover into their work which will bring a lot of scale and interesting use cases to the ecosystem, for example, onchain Gaming and ZKML,” he said.\nThis sentiment is shared by Liron Hayman, the head of business development at Starkware.\n“This is a very important milestone towards decentralization of the Starknet tech stack. Andrew was able to develop his prover without viewing the code of StarkWare’s prover,” Hayman told Blockworks. “A mature decentralized blockchain like Starknet requires a vibrant community developing multiple implementations of each component. Andrew’s work is taking STARK technology to serious decentralization — and by extension, towards fulfilling its potential.”\nMilson believes his work can also be viewed as an audit of StarkNet’s existing verifier and a testament to the security of the network.\n“I inspected every line of code and I couldn’t find a bug which was honestly a bit disappointing considering how juicy StarkNet’s bug bounty program is, but really impressive on StarkWare’s behalf,” Milson said.\nUpdated on Aug. 14, 2023 at 12:10 pm ET: Andrew Milson is no longer a senior software engineer at Immutable. \nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "content": "\n<p>The founder of Vessel Steph Alinsug sees on-chain media as a “huge unlock” for how brands will develop relationships with consumers in the “next era of brand-building.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alinsug reflects on earlier days in social media. When Instagram launched, she says, “it changed the way we build brands.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Now, all of a sudden, you had to have a content strategy.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking with host Chase Chapman on the On the Other Side podcast (<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/3uzurPD5IPfz5gGSpSKLJW\">Spotify</a>/<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/83-onchain-media-w-steph-alinsug-cryptohun3y/id1570685120?i=1000623913400\">Apple</a>), Alinsug explains how social media transformed marketing. “You had to produce assets like JPEGs or video or you just had to produce content, and we didn’t really know what the implications of that was going to be.

      "contentSnippet": "The founder of Vessel Steph Alinsug sees on-chain media as a “huge unlock” for how brands will develop relationships with consumers in the “next era of brand-building.”\nAlinsug reflects on earlier days in social media. When Instagram launched, she says, “it changed the way we build brands.”\n“Now, all of a sudden, you had to have a content strategy.”\nSpeaking with host Chase Chapman on the On the Other Side podcast (Spotify/Apple), Alinsug explains how social media transformed marketing. “You had to produce assets like JPEGs or video or you just had to produce content, and we didn’t really know what the implications of that was going to be. We just knew that it was something we had to do.”\nBrands could connect directly to customers through social media and email marketing, Alinsug explains.

      "content": "\n<p>More developers may soon be able to play a role in advancing zero-knowledge technology.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto research team has published a paper that outlines two new zero-knowledge (zk) proof technologies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, the two most popular technologies used for zk rollups are zkVMs (zero-knowledge virtual machines) and SNARKs (Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SNARKs and zkVMs are both cryptographic constructs that allow participants to prove that their transactions are legitimate without revealing certain details of those transactions. They offer both scalability benefits (since less data needs to be stored and processed) and privacy benefits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first zk rollups to reach mainnet have already accumulated over $1 billion in total value locked, per <a href=\"https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary\">L2beat</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But existing SNARK technology can be significantly improved, Justin Thaler, a research partner at <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/a16z\">a16z</a>, told Blockworks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Current SNARK implementations are sufficiently complicated, they’re almost certainly full of bugs, which could make them useless security-wise,” Thaler said. “We’re talking 10s, 1000s of lines of code, very difficult to understand, and it’s very, very hard to imagine there is not a single bug in these code bases.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team at a16z crypto research — in conjunction with researchers from Microsoft, Carnegie Mellon and NYU —&nbsp;have developed a new approach to this problem: Lasso and Jolt.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Meet Lasso and Jolt</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lasso can be used in cryptography to shorten encrypted computational complexities, making them easier to apply practically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“A key component for modern performative SNARK deployments is something called a lookup argument,” Thaler explained. “Lasso is a new lookup argument with a significantly faster prover.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Engineers at a16z initially implementing Lasso conclude that it’s an order of magnitude improvement over existing lookup arguments, Thaler said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The prover is 10x faster — and that’s with our initial, not very optimized implementation,” he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jolt is a framework used primarily to restructure, convert and change data. Thaler explained that Jolt uses the Lasso lookup argument as a building block to give what is a new approach to designing zkVMs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“So what we’re doing is turning each step of the virtual machine into a Lasso,” Thaler said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Simplifying zk tech for developers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This vision is not necessarily new and comes close to realizing what <a href=\"https://github.com/barryWhiteHat\">Barry Whitehat</a> from the Ethereum Foundation calls “lookup singularity.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The vision is let’s do SNARK design by only doing lookups,” said Thaler. “We won’t have developers coding by hand very optimized circuits, which is very labor intensive and difficult to audit…we’re coming close to achieving a vision that a lookup can do all virtual machine execution with Lasso.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Riad Wahby, an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University and co-author on the research paper, told Blockworks that it’s unlikely that current zk-rollup implementations will directly benefit from the research, but that the next generation might.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“For me that’s where the real excitement comes with something like Lasso is that it really enables like much more efficient general purpose, generally programmable proving systems,” Wahby told Blockworks. “Instead of having maybe 100 people in the world who can make significant progress on building the next roll-up, now it’s much wider open, and we’ll see much more innovation.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lowering barriers to use elliptic curve cryptography</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>SNARKs often use a combination of cryptographic primitives, including but not limited to elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and hashing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hashing and ECC are designed for different cryptographic purposes, and while hashing is critical for data integrity checks, ECC is commonly used for encryption and digital signature purposes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There’s nothing fundamentally insecure about hashing-based SNARKS. But for hashing-based SNARKS, they give the protocol designer the flexibility to trade off performance for security,” Thaler said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefit of the Lasso and Jolt technique, Thaler contended, is that it is designed to make elliptic curve cryptography more performative and efficient and removes the need to rely on hashing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“People who really care about performance might no longer feel such a push to go to the hashing-based [SNARKS],” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is it VHS vs Betamax or VHS to DVD?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the immediate term, the a16z crypto research team has published a draft version of the code on a16z’s GitHub page and hopes to receive external contributions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Taking Lasso and turning it into Jolt will be a significant effort. And we’re hoping not just to do it ourselves,” Thaler said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the long term, Thaler hopes the wider ecosystem will build on the code base and techniques introduced by its research paper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wahby thinks there is a year or two of engineering work ahead before the research can be turned into production-ready proof systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s sort of a total ground up redesign,” Wahby said. But the potential benefits may be worth the wait. “We certainly have room for a VHS to DVD kind of jump,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex Pruden, CEO of Aleo, a privacy-focused zk-based blockchain, told Blockworks in an interview that there are several techniques from the Lasso paper that it plans to integrate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Lasso builds on a body of prior work, and the innovations described in the paper are exactly why an open-source ecosystem is such a powerful force for innovation.” Pruden said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Updated Aug. 10, 2023 at 12:18 pm: Lasso is also not an acronym, as was stated in a previous version of this article. It also listed an incorrect title for Riad Wahby. He is an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\">\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter?source=end\">Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter</a>&nbsp;now.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want alpha sent directly to your inbox?

      "contentSnippet": "More developers may soon be able to play a role in advancing zero-knowledge technology. \nAndreessen Horowitz’s crypto research team has published a paper that outlines two new zero-knowledge (zk) proof technologies.\nCurrently, the two most popular technologies used for zk rollups are zkVMs (zero-knowledge virtual machines) and SNARKs (Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge). \nSNARKs and zkVMs are both cryptographic constructs that allow participants to prove that their transactions are legitimate without revealing certain details of those transactions. They offer both scalability benefits (since less data needs to be stored and processed) and privacy benefits. \nThe first zk rollups to reach mainnet have already accumulated over $1 billion in total value locked, per L2beat.\nBut existing SNARK technology can be significantly improved, Justin Thaler, a research partner at a16z, told Blockworks. \n“Current SNARK implementations are sufficiently complicated, they’re almost certainly full of bugs, which could make them useless security-wise,” Thaler said. “We’re talking 10s, 1000s of lines of code, very difficult to understand, and it’s very, very hard to imagine there is not a single bug in these code bases.”\nThe team at a16z crypto research — in conjunction with researchers from Microsoft, Carnegie Mellon and NYU — have developed a new approach to this problem: Lasso and Jolt.\nMeet Lasso and Jolt\nLasso can be used in cryptography to shorten encrypted computational complexities, making them easier to apply practically.\n“A key component for modern performative SNARK deployments is something called a lookup argument,” Thaler explained. “Lasso is a new lookup argument with a significantly faster prover.” \nEngineers at a16z initially implementing Lasso conclude that it’s an order of magnitude improvement over existing lookup arguments, Thaler said. \n“The prover is 10x faster — and that’s with our initial, not very optimized implementation,” he said. \nJolt is a framework used primarily to restructure, convert and change data. Thaler explained that Jolt uses the Lasso lookup argument as a building block to give what is a new approach to designing zkVMs. \n“So what we’re doing is turning each step of the virtual machine into a Lasso,” Thaler said.\nSimplifying zk tech for developers\nThis vision is not necessarily new and comes close to realizing what Barry Whitehat from the Ethereum Foundation calls “lookup singularity.”\n“The vision is let’s do SNARK design by only doing lookups,” said Thaler. “We won’t have developers coding by hand very optimized circuits, which is very labor intensive and difficult to audit…we’re coming close to achieving a vision that a lookup can do all virtual machine execution with Lasso.”\nRiad Wahby, an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University and co-author on the research paper, told Blockworks that it’s unlikely that current zk-rollup implementations will directly benefit from the research, but that the next generation might. \n“For me that’s where the real excitement comes with something like Lasso is that it really enables like much more efficient general purpose, generally programmable proving systems,” Wahby told Blockworks. “Instead of having maybe 100 people in the world who can make significant progress on building the next roll-up, now it’s much wider open, and we’ll see much more innovation.”\nLowering barriers to use elliptic curve cryptography\nSNARKs often use a combination of cryptographic primitives, including but not limited to elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and hashing.\nHashing and ECC are designed for different cryptographic purposes, and while hashing is critical for data integrity checks, ECC is commonly used for encryption and digital signature purposes. \n“There’s nothing fundamentally insecure about hashing-based SNARKS. But for hashing-based SNARKS, they give the protocol designer the flexibility to trade off performance for security,” Thaler said.\nThe benefit of the Lasso and Jolt technique, Thaler contended, is that it is designed to make elliptic curve cryptography more performative and efficient and removes the need to rely on hashing.\n“People who really care about performance might no longer feel such a push to go to the hashing-based [SNARKS],” he said.\nIs it VHS vs Betamax or VHS to DVD? \nIn the immediate term, the a16z crypto research team has published a draft version of the code on a16z’s GitHub page and hopes to receive external contributions. \n“Taking Lasso and turning it into Jolt will be a significant effort. And we’re hoping not just to do it ourselves,” Thaler said.\nIn the long term, Thaler hopes the wider ecosystem will build on the code base and techniques introduced by its research paper.\nWahby thinks there is a year or two of engineering work ahead before the research can be turned into production-ready proof systems.\n“It’s sort of a total ground up redesign,” Wahby said. But the potential benefits may be worth the wait. “We certainly have room for a VHS to DVD kind of jump,” he said.\nAlex Pruden, CEO of Aleo, a privacy-focused zk-based blockchain, told Blockworks in an interview that there are several techniques from the Lasso paper that it plans to integrate.\n“Lasso builds on a body of prior work, and the innovations described in the paper are exactly why an open-source ecosystem is such a powerful force for innovation.” Pruden said.\nUpdated Aug. 10, 2023 at 12:18 pm: Lasso is also not an acronym, as was stated in a previous version of this article. It also listed an incorrect title for Riad Wahby. He is an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?
