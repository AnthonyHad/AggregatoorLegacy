        "content": "\n<p>For the second time in just a matter of weeks, a DeFi protocol has taken unusual measures to prevent systemic risk relating to a lending position.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p> The Binance Smart Chain-based lending protocol, Venus, announced on Thursday night that a notorious quarter-billion dollar position was “made healthy” by the BNB core team following a liquidation of $33 million worth of Binance Coin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\" class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Following today’s market movement, the BNB Bridge exploiter account was made healthy as promised by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BNBCHAIN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BNBCHAIN</a> using whitelisted liquidation without any resulting shortfall or further impact to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24bnb&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$bnb</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/TGZ7nbiDPN\">https://t.co/TGZ7nbiDPN</a></p>— Venus Protocol (@VenusProtocol) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VenusProtocol/status/1692421277762412586?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 18, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The position was first created in October 2022 following one of the largest hacks in crypto history. An attacker — now widely believed to be the North Korean-affiliated Lazarus Group — stole 2 million Binance Coin (<a href=\"https://blockworks.co/price/bnb\">BNB</a>) worth over a half billion dollars at the time from a cross-chain bridge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unable to offload their haul without drastically reducing the BNB price, the attacker hesitated. They might have feared a chain rollback or another retaliatory action from Binance. Instead, the attacker deposited hundreds of millions into Venus as collateral. This allowed them to secure a massive $150 million stablecoin loan, most of which was then <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SlowMist_Team/status/1578159110708940801?s=20&amp;t=l3ut_4eHdcnOIU7oz0ibhQ\">bridged</a> to other chains and exchanged for ETH.

        "contentSnippet": "For the second time in just a matter of weeks, a DeFi protocol has taken unusual measures to prevent systemic risk relating to a lending position. \n The Binance Smart Chain-based lending protocol, Venus, announced on Thursday night that a notorious quarter-billion dollar position was “made healthy” by the BNB core team following a liquidation of $33 million worth of Binance Coin. \n\n\nFollowing today’s market movement, the BNB Bridge exploiter account was made healthy as promised by @BNBCHAIN using whitelisted liquidation without any resulting shortfall or further impact to $bnb https://t.co/TGZ7nbiDPN\n— Venus Protocol (@VenusProtocol) August 18, 2023\n\n\n\n\nThe position was first created in October 2022 following one of the largest hacks in crypto history. An attacker — now widely believed to be the North Korean-affiliated Lazarus Group — stole 2 million Binance Coin (BNB) worth over a half billion dollars at the time from a cross-chain bridge. \nUnable to offload their haul without drastically reducing the BNB price, the attacker hesitated. They might have feared a chain rollback or another retaliatory action from Binance. Instead, the attacker deposited hundreds of millions into Venus as collateral. This allowed them to secure a massive $150 million stablecoin loan, most of which was then bridged to other chains and exchanged for ETH. Only a minor portion of it was frozen by Tether. It is unlikely the attacker ever intended to repay this debt.\nPer data from DeFiLlama, at the time of the attack the deposit from the exploiter accounted for nearly 20% of Venus’ total value locked, and limited liquidity for BNB meant that liquidating the position could pose existential risks for Venus in the form of bad debt. \nAs a result, in November the BNB core team successfully proposed becoming the sole liquidator responsible for the position via Venus governance.\n“As the market is very volatile, there is potential risk that if liquidated, there is potential this large portion of BNB may cause more cascading liquidation effect and unnecessary damage to the market and cause more risks to Venus, Venus users, BNB token, and BNB chain,” a core team representative wrote in the formal vote. \nThe position then largely sat dormant until June 2023, as the price of BNB fell close to liquidation threshold. $30 million tether (USDT) was added to the liquidator address, adding to an initial $30 million BUSD position. \nLast night, amid a marketwide rout, BNB dipped below the liquidation threshold of roughly $220 million, leading the assigned BNB core team liquidation address to step in. \nIn an interview with Blockworks, pseudonymous Venus BD & Community Lead “Danny” confirmed that – despite widespread reporting that the liquidation was for over $60 million – the BNB core team seized $33 million of BNB collateral by liquidating $30 million in USDT in debt across a series of three transactions. \nEven with the liquidation the protocol may not be out of the woods, as Debank shows that the health rate of the position is perilously low, and another downturn could lead to further liquidations at a price of roughly $210.8 per BNB. After the liquidations today, the liquidator address has an additional $29.9 million in stables remaining, relative to $126 million in outstanding remaining debt. \n“BNB Chain will continue to monitor and manage the health of the account as necessary,” said Danny. \nLending markets under stress\nVenus is not the only lending market to come under stress in recent weeks. \nOn July 31, decentralized exchange Curve Finance suffered a $70 million hack. While much of the losses were later recovered or seized by whitehats, one of the greatest losses was to a CRV/ETH pool, which was central to CRV’s onchain liquidity. \nCRV’s liquidity depth and price soon became a focal point for the DeFi community, as Curve founder Michael Egorov had outstanding loans worth upwards of $110 million owed to various protocols using CRV as collateral.

While this may be a useful feature to protect users’ privacy, in the absence of supervision and regulation this feature also facilitates tax evasion and increases the difficulty of preventing money laundering and fighting the financing of terrorism and other illicit activities.” \nThe report’s authors advise the central bank to continue to monitor stablecoins and their inherent risks, as they could potentially justify issuing a CBDC down the line.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

Each social media site is a walled garden, your data is kept in application siloes, and the app owners will do everything they can to keep you there. They especially don’t want you to try and take your data (your digital reputation) with you. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, you name it, they are data aggregators, and that data is the extractable value that they monetize to keep the wheel spinning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t know about you, but I don’t like it. I actually want to own my own data, my digital identity, and my online reputation. Then, I want to take it with me wherever I go. Web3 is going to do that for me, for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What could Threads and Facebook have done differently?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Threads connected directly to Instagram, allowing new users to start with a built-in network and avoid awkward first posts in an empty space. Simultaneously, Meta announced <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-activitypub-understanding-the-social-media-protocol-metas-threads-plans-to-use/\">plans</a> to work with the ActivityPub Protocol to create seamless connections and interactions with other sites. ActivityPub is already working, and some lesser-known social media sites — such as Mastodon, Pixelfed, PeerTube, Lemmy and Kbin — are using it to allow cross-platform interactions and communications, the result of which is called “The Fediverse.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Facebook, Instagram and Threads are supposedly next to join the “Fediverse,” it will show a significant change of direction. Connecting platforms and lowering the garden walls will force Meta to choose whether to give up centralization (and lose valuable data) or sacrifice user experience (and lose valuable users).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">My verdict on shared identity</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe there’s a better approach that Meta could have taken.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your reputation in Web3 is surely best served by an identifier for your digital self. That identifier should also act as a self-sovereign data container that is 100% owned by you, that you can use for logins, verify ownership, make and receive payments and complete know-your-customer (KYC) checks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your followers, content and data should all be connected to you, not the platforms you use. Your digital self will be kept safely in your unique wallet, accessible only to you. Permission for others to engage with you will be 100% yours, and they will know that it’s 100% you that they’re engaging with.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, your digital life will be tied into one identity. Not only will this provide more autonomy for users, but it could usher in a safer, more transparent and more connected internet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\">\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-post-author-biography\">Matthew Gould is CEO and co-founder of Unstoppable Domains, a Web3 domain name provider working to onboard the world onto web3.

They especially don’t want you to try and take your data (your digital reputation) with you. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, you name it, they are data aggregators, and that data is the extractable value that they monetize to keep the wheel spinning.\nI don’t know about you, but I don’t like it. I actually want to own my own data, my digital identity, and my online reputation. Then, I want to take it with me wherever I go. Web3 is going to do that for me, for us.\nWhat could Threads and Facebook have done differently?\nThreads connected directly to Instagram, allowing new users to start with a built-in network and avoid awkward first posts in an empty space. Simultaneously, Meta announced plans to work with the ActivityPub Protocol to create seamless connections and interactions with other sites. ActivityPub is already working, and some lesser-known social media sites — such as Mastodon, Pixelfed, PeerTube, Lemmy and Kbin — are using it to allow cross-platform interactions and communications, the result of which is called “The Fediverse.” \nIf Facebook, Instagram and Threads are supposedly next to join the “Fediverse,” it will show a significant change of direction. Connecting platforms and lowering the garden walls will force Meta to choose whether to give up centralization (and lose valuable data) or sacrifice user experience (and lose valuable users). \nMy verdict on shared identity\nI believe there’s a better approach that Meta could have taken. \nYour reputation in Web3 is surely best served by an identifier for your digital self. That identifier should also act as a self-sovereign data container that is 100% owned by you, that you can use for logins, verify ownership, make and receive payments and complete know-your-customer (KYC) checks. \nYour followers, content and data should all be connected to you, not the platforms you use. Your digital self will be kept safely in your unique wallet, accessible only to you. Permission for others to engage with you will be 100% yours, and they will know that it’s 100% you that they’re engaging with. \nFinally, your digital life will be tied into one identity. Not only will this provide more autonomy for users, but it could usher in a safer, more transparent and more connected internet. \nMatthew Gould is CEO and co-founder of Unstoppable Domains, a Web3 domain name provider working to onboard the world onto web3.

essential for the growth of the tokenization market.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in a March <a

Moreover, even if deemed property, “Tornado Cash does not have a ‘legal or equitable claim or right in property’ to them,” they argued.\nBut Pitman said: “The court finds that OFAC’s determination that the smart contracts constitute property, or an interest in property, is not plainly inconsistent with the regulatory definition of those terms.”\nHe also likened smart contracts to vending machines, noting they execute a specific, preset function.\n“The fact that smart contracts do so without additional human intervention, like a vending machine, or that they are immutable, does not affect its status as type of contract and, thus, a type of property within the meaning of the regulation,” he added.\nCritics have argued the sanctions have a chilling effect and violate free speech rights of software developers, but the court rejected that view.\nOne Tornado Cash developer, awaiting trial in the Netherlands for alleged involvement in money laundering, was detained for 8 months before being released in April.\nThe court ruled in favor of the government on the matter through a summary judgment, and the case now is expected to go to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for review.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

Assets that rose the most over the last month were the hardest hit.”\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1.1% to 13,316 by mid-afternoon on Thursday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also slipped 0.8% to 34,474\nThe case for Evergrande\nThe crypto turmoil coincides with a broader sell-off in risk assets. Evergrande Group, China’s one-time second-largest property developer, filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in New York on Thursday. \nThe firm’s extensive borrowing led to its default in 2021, triggering a severe property downturn in China’s economy. At the time, officials from the People’s Bank of China sought to downplay the risks to financial markets, arguing a contagion-wide effect had been contained.\nAccording to Michael Rinko, research analyst at Delphi Digital, China is undergoing an extensive, state-driven deleveraging of the real estate sector. \nThe situation has shaken confidence and demand across the nation, with recent indications such as a recent rate cut by the People’s Bank of China hinting at developing economic cracks.\nInvestment manager Cathie Wood of Ark Invest also weighed in, asserting that China is exporting deflation more extensively than many economists realize. \nAn unfolding deflationary trend in China, exacerbated by recent defaults within the real estate and trust industries, may be nearing a 20% impact, she noted.\nWood also expressed concerns over the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hikes, which she contends have exacerbated global deflationary risks. The unprecedented 22-fold increase in the Federal Reserve’s funds rate may be impacting China first, with potential repercussions for the global economy to come later, the CEO added.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

To ensure the security of these Modules, Registries exist to enforce standards. \nSchor told Blockworks that the Safe Core Protocol aims to address issues around interoperability and security. \n“In the long run, we want you to be able to plug your different smart accounts into the same protocol, it’s all interoperable, and it all leverages the same security properties,” said Schor.\nOver the next few months, the team will seek community feedback on the proposed protocol.\n“We wanted to get the white paper out early even though we’re still working on the actual implementation to get early community feedback,” Schor said. “It gets harder to change things as we go along, so we want to get feedback as early as possible when things are still very flexible.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

        "contentSnippet": "Derivatives marketplace CME Group is set to launch reference rates for bitcoin and ether catered toward Asian investors — a variant to existing rates focused on those in London and New York.\nDeveloped with index provider CF Benchmarks, the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate APAC and CME CF Ether-Dollar Reference Rate APAC are set to be available on Sept. 11, the companies revealed Wednesday.\nSo far in 2023, 37% of CME Group’s total crypto volume has traded outside of US hours, according to Giovanni Vicioso, the company’s global head of cryptocurrency products. About 11% of trades come from the Asia Pacific (APAC) region. \nCME launched its Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR) — a daily reference rate of the US dollar price of one bitcoin as of 4 pm London time — in 2016. It followed that up with an Ether Reference Rate in 2018.\nThe BRR aggregates trade flow of major bitcoin spot exchanges during a one-hour window before taking the average of the volume-weighted medians across the 12 five-minute intervals of that span. \nThis calculation “ensures tradability and replicability in the underlying spot markets,” according to the company.\nCME Group launched BTC and ETH reference rates to be published at 4 pm New York time in February 2022. \nThe upcoming rates will be published at 4 pm Hong Kong and Singapore time. \n“As we continue to see more institutional clients use our bitcoin and ether futures products in active portfolios or structured products like ETFs, these APAC reference rates will allow market participants to more accurately and precisely hedge cryptocurrency price risk with timing more closely aligned to their portfolios,” Vicioso said in a statement. \nThe CME Group offering expansion came the same day Coinbase revealed it was cleared to offer eligible US customers access to regulated crypto futures directly from its platforms. The global crypto derivatives market represents roughly 75% of global crypto trading volume, the crypto exchange said. \nThe average daily volume for CME Group’s crypto futures during the second quarter amounted to 38,600 contracts, while open interest averaged 79,200 contracts.\nCME Group noted in a July report that the number of large open interest holders of bitcoin futures — defined as an entity that holds at least 25 futures contracts — averaged a record of 107 during the quarter.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

        "content": "\n<p>Dapp (dencentralized app) development team Smol recently released MultiSafe, which enables users to keep the same address across multiple blockchains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The newly launched dapp builds on the work of Safe, previously known as Gnosis Safe, which develops modular infrastructure for user access and management of their crypto holdings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of its most well-known products, Safe Wallet, is a smart contract wallet designed to simplify the user experience of having multiple owners or signers — known as a multisig.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem, according to Smol core contributor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/draper_forms\">draper</a>, was that when people use different addresses for their Safe across different chains and layer-2s, things can get confusing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We built MultiSafe to be the simplest way for anyone to deploy a Safe on the most used chains and have the same address on all of them.

        "contentSnippet": "Dapp (dencentralized app) development team Smol recently released MultiSafe, which enables users to keep the same address across multiple blockchains.\nThe newly launched dapp builds on the work of Safe, previously known as Gnosis Safe, which develops modular infrastructure for user access and management of their crypto holdings. \nOne of its most well-known products, Safe Wallet, is a smart contract wallet designed to simplify the user experience of having multiple owners or signers — known as a multisig. \nThe problem, according to Smol core contributor draper, was that when people use different addresses for their Safe across different chains and layer-2s, things can get confusing.\n“We built MultiSafe to be the simplest way for anyone to deploy a Safe on the most used chains and have the same address on all of them. Users can deploy a totally new safe or clone an existing one in just a couple of clicks,” draper said.\nMultiSafe was officially announced on Aug. 11. At the time, the team wrote that its release “continues Smol’s mission of creating simple to use and functional dapps designed to solve crypto pain points.”\nSo how does MultiSafe work?\nMultiSafe is designed so that users can deploy a new Safe across multiple different chains within seconds whilst keeping the same address. \n“If you already have a safe, you can ‘clone’ that safe onto other chains and keep the original address,” draper explained. “Under the hood, MultiSafe is using Safe’s own factory system which allows anyone to deploy Safe related contracts to any chain.”\nThis is accomplished by taking advantage of Safe’s deterministic logic, they said.

Users can trade on Vertex “as if you would trade on a centralized exchange,” according to Peng.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vertex, he says, is “something that looks like a centralized exchange, feels like a centralized exchange, but just so happens to be decentralized.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peng emphasizes that while users maintain custody of their assets, the exchange does centralize certain aspects of its offering to ensure rapid trading performance. “We can process all trades and order placements optimistically on our own server and that way, you’re not waiting for a light to travel from different nodes to each other and all of them to reach consensus.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Centralized servers are fast — and we like that,” he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cross-chain messaging for multi-chain trading</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Vertex co-founder Darius Tabatabai says that the team would like to be able to provide assets across multiple chains at some point in the future. “Logically,” he says, “you want all your liquidity and trading to be happening in one place.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You want all your capital on each account to be accounted for in one place as well to keep the capital-efficiency.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this reason, Tabatabai rules out a <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/uniswap\">Uniswap</a>-style model “where you just fork the code and put a different version of the code on 20 different chains.” Instead, he anticipates using a cross-chain messaging service. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/wormhole\">Wormhole</a> interoperability technology could bring in assets, take deposits on different chains, and bring them to Arbitrum, where user accounts would interact with the Arbitrum instance of the protocol, he explains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Any time they want to withdraw,” he says, “they withdraw to their home chain.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s quite a big piece of work,” Tabatabai admits, “but [Peng] is probably the guy to do it, given that he worked on Wormhole previously and has exposure to this from previous roles.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We haven’t got the exact plan mapped out, but we’re pretty confident we can do something decent in that space.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peng explains how performance would be maintained in a cross-chain environment. “Most of the things that people sign don’t end up on-chain,” he explains. “It just goes to our matching engine directly.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peng uses an example of a user moving from the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/optimism\">Optimism</a> chain to trade on Vertex, illustrating the “ideal user experience.”&nbsp; The user would send the transaction on Optimism to make a deposit and on the backend, it would be bridged to Arbitrum. “They are not exposed to the bridge in UX, at all.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might take around two minutes, according to Peng, for the assets to switch over to <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/arbitrum\">Arbitrum</a>, “and then after that, they can just trade normally, <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/simplify-crypto-user-experience\">as if it was a centralized exchange</a>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\">\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter?source=end\">Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter</a>&nbsp;now.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want alpha sent directly to your inbox?

Users can trade on Vertex “as if you would trade on a centralized exchange,” according to Peng.\nVertex, he says, is “something that looks like a centralized exchange, feels like a centralized exchange, but just so happens to be decentralized.”\nPeng emphasizes that while users maintain custody of their assets, the exchange does centralize certain aspects of its offering to ensure rapid trading performance. “We can process all trades and order placements optimistically on our own server and that way, you’re not waiting for a light to travel from different nodes to each other and all of them to reach consensus.”\n“Centralized servers are fast — and we like that,” he says.\nCross-chain messaging for multi-chain trading\nVertex co-founder Darius Tabatabai says that the team would like to be able to provide assets across multiple chains at some point in the future. “Logically,” he says, “you want all your liquidity and trading to be happening in one place.” \n“You want all your capital on each account to be accounted for in one place as well to keep the capital-efficiency.”\nFor this reason, Tabatabai rules out a Uniswap-style model “where you just fork the code and put a different version of the code on 20 different chains.” Instead, he anticipates using a cross-chain messaging service. Wormhole interoperability technology could bring in assets, take deposits on different chains, and bring them to Arbitrum, where user accounts would interact with the Arbitrum instance of the protocol, he explains.\n“Any time they want to withdraw,” he says, “they withdraw to their home chain.”\n“It’s quite a big piece of work,” Tabatabai admits, “but [Peng] is probably the guy to do it, given that he worked on Wormhole previously and has exposure to this from previous roles.”\n“We haven’t got the exact plan mapped out, but we’re pretty confident we can do something decent in that space.” \n\n\n\n\nPeng explains how performance would be maintained in a cross-chain environment. “Most of the things that people sign don’t end up on-chain,” he explains. “It just goes to our matching engine directly.”\nPeng uses an example of a user moving from the Optimism chain to trade on Vertex, illustrating the “ideal user experience.”  The user would send the transaction on Optimism to make a deposit and on the backend, it would be bridged to Arbitrum. “They are not exposed to the bridge in UX, at all.”\nIt might take around two minutes, according to Peng, for the assets to switch over to Arbitrum, “and then after that, they can just trade normally, as if it was a centralized exchange.”\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

But unlike the metaverse, a concept which arguably has a real connection to blockchain, you can’t convince me that AI has anything really to do with cryptocurrency technology. \nThe two are both wild digital phenomenons in an internet age, yes, but they are actually entirely mutually exclusive.\nThe truth is that cryptocurrency may need AI, but AI may not need cryptocurrency.\nBecause now that you really think about it, do you think that the AI industry even wants to be this closely associated with the crypto one? Did they actually have any say in the matter? \nPerhaps we’ll soon see AI politely removing crypto’s desperate grasp from around its shoulders, placing crypto’s proverbial arm back by its side…and walking away.\nI don’t care much about tech, I don’t care a whole lot about finance, either. I care about writing stories and watching weird things unfold. And that’s why I’ve ended up in crypto. \nBut because I’m missing that passion for what crypto and blockchain are all about — finance, tech, privacy, yadda yadda — I’m going to write instead about what I am actually interested in. Everything about crypto that has very little to do with crypto.\nThat’s what this column will be about. All the tangential stories that come out of the blockchain and crypto space, what I think about them, and how I navigate it all as a skeptical former Russian literature major.\nIt’s precisely my perch as an outsider that lets me do what I do: Opine on all sides of any crypto issue, no strings attached, no skin in the game.\nIf you want to talk crypto with me, let’s go off topic.",

The platform will have “institutional grade trading features” and will have a “on and off-ramp for fiat payments.”\nAfter the platform goes live, M2 is planning to “increase the number of assets and services offered to include derivatives along with a market leading yield product,” according to the statement.\nAbu Dhabi financial regulator also recently granted crypto company Rain the same license it awarded to M2.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?

This technology will serve as a building block for a compliant and orderly digital asset securities marketplace that protects investors and serves their best interests.”\nMcHenry isn’t the only one concerned with the Prometheum approval. In July, Representative Ritchie Torres D-N.Y. asked the SEC to open an investigation into how the company — which “has not yet served a single customer” according to McHenry’s letters — was granted a license.\nThe Blockchain Association has also expressed its concern over the alleged “sweetheart” deal between Prometheum and the SEC.\nUpdated Tuesday, August 15 at 5:20 pm ET: Added statement from Prometheum\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your email every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nWant alpha sent directly to your inbox?
